We use N0/Nπ to denote noise presented in-phase/out-of-phase between ears and S0/Sπ to denote a 500 Hz sine wave signal as in/out-of-phase. Signal detection level for the noise/signal combinations N0Sπ and NπS0 is typically 10–20 dB better than for N0S0. All combinations have the same spectrum, level, and duration of both the signal and the noise. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nTen participants (5 female), age: 22–43, with N0Sπ-N0S0 MLDs greater than 10 dB, were imaged using a sparse BOLD fMRI sequence, with a 9 second gap (1 second quiet preceding stimuli). Band-pass (400–600 Hz) noise and an enveloped signal (.25 second tone burst, 50% duty-cycle) were used to create the stimuli. Brain maps of statistically significant regions were formed from a second-level analysis using SPM5. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe contrast NπS0- N0Sπ had significant regions of activation in the right pulvinar, corpus callosum, and insula bilaterally. The left inferior frontal gyrus had significant activation for contrasts N0Sπ-N0S0 and NπS0-N0S0. The contrast N0S0-N0Sπ revealed a region in the right insula, and the contrast N0S0-NπS0 had a region of significance in the left insula. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur results extend the view that the thalamus acts as a gating mechanism to enable dichotic listening, and suggest that MLD processing is accomplished through thalamic communication with the insula, which communicate across the corpus callosum to either enhance or diminish the binaural signal (depending on the MLD condition). The audibility improvement of the signal with both MLD conditions is likely reflected by activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, a late stage in the what/where model of auditory processing. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe brain takes advantage of phase differences of binaural auditory stimuli to improve listening ability. An example is that a signal presented within a noise background can have greater than a 10 dB lower (better) detection threshold if it is presented out-of-phase rather than in-phase between ears, when the noise is interaurally in phase. The difference between these signal detection thresholds is known as a masking level difference (MLD). The contrasted stimuli used to determine MLDs can be identical in terms of intensity level, spectrum, and duration, yet the audibility of the signal is very different. The full neural network specific to the processing of binaural MLD stimuli is not well understood, nor has it been extensively investigated using functional imaging. We therefore utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to localize neural regions involved in MLD processing. \n\nLicklider (1948)  , by altering the phase of speech presented in a noise background, found intelligibility highest with noise in-phase between ears, and the speech 180° (π radians) out-of-phase between ears. Hirsh (1948)   showed a detection advantage for a tone presented binaurally in background noise if the tone source was 180° out-of-phase between the two ears, compared to when both channels of the tone were in-phase. Following Hirsh’s work, psychoacoustic studies were performed to characterize the influence of the frequency of the signal, the bandwidth of the noise, and the phase and level differences between ears in affecting the magnitude of the MLD  – . In an experiment that increased the masker from 5 to 65 dB SPL (sound pressure level), the MLD increased from 3.5 to roughly 15 dB  . The magnitude of the MLD has been found to decrease as the center frequency of the masker (signal frequency) increased  , and increase with a decrease in the bandwidth of the masker. There is an increase in the magnitude of the MLD with an increase in the duration of the signal up to approximately 500 ms  ,  ,  . Interaural phase and time delay differences of the noise and signal have also been investigated. The best detection (lowest signal threshold level) occurred when either the signal or noise was 180° out-of-phase  ,  . \n\nWe denote stimuli presented in-phase between ears with a 0, and π (radians) if presented out-of-phase. Both N0Sπ (noise in-phase, signal out-of-phase) and NπS0 (noise out-of-phase, signal in-phase) have a signal detection advantage compared to N0S0 (noise in-phase, signal in-phase). The MLD is the difference in the participant’s signal intensity threshold between MLD conditions, N0Sπ or NπS0, and the control condition N0S0. The MLD found with the N0Sπ-N0S0 comparison is typically larger (on the order of 2 dB) than NπS0-N0S0 comparison. Both are typically over 10 dB, and in individual cases can be greater than 20 dB  ,  . \n\nIt is reasonable to expect auditory regions such as the inferior colliculus (IC) and auditory cortex (AC) to play an important role in the neural processing of MLD stimuli, and these regions have been investigated in animals. A series of studies by Jiang et al.  ,   and Palmer et al.   showed differences in neuron firing rates in the IC of the guinea pig related to S0 and Sπ, whereas the condition Nπ created little if any response, likely due to the de-synchronization of the stimuli. A study by Guo and Burkard   showed an increased near-field response in the auditory cortex (AC) of the chinchilla for MLD conditions compared to the control condition. \n\nHuman studies using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings have indicated a cortical rather than brainstem MLD response. For example, Fowler and Mikami   showed that the slow vertex component P2 thresholds for signal detection in both N0Sπ and N0S0 conditions increased linearly with increasing noise level. N0Sπ increased with a smaller (better detection) slope than N0S0, consistent with the findings that the MLD increases for higher overall intensity levels. In a follow up study  , Fowler and Mikami were unable to show an MLD in the middle latency response (MLR); the MLR is thought to arise from midbrain, thalamic and cortical regions of the auditory nervous system  . Wong and Stapells   used an amplitude-modulated signal component to evoke an auditory steady state response (ASSR), and found an MLD for the 7 and 13 Hz modulations rates for N0Sπ-N0S0, but not for NπS0-N0S0. Neither showed a difference at 80 Hz rates. Ishida and Stapells   were unable to find an MLD for the 40-Hz ASSR. These ASSR findings parallel the previous studies, if one accepts the view that ASSR modulation frequencies (>70–80) Hz result from superimposed brainstem response, those near 40 Hz reflect superimposed midbrain, thalamic and early cortical responses, and those of very low frequencies (<20 Hz) represent superimposed cortical responses. \n\nAnimal-based studies have investigated specific sites such as the IC and AC, whereas human-based psychoacoustic or evoked potential studies are less localizing. Dichotic listening studies, which use language-based tokens and require a participant to attend to a target in either ear, suggest a high level involvement (that includes the thalamus) may be required for processing the MLD. These studies often find a right ear advantage (REA) in attending to stimuli in the right ear, when competing tokens are presented in the left ear, as opposed to vice versa. Kimura proposed a model explaining REA, which included a right to left hemisphere crossing of auditory (speech) information  . Perceptually, differences in MLD conditions can be quite large, although acoustically the different MLD conditions are very close to each other, and typically only differ in the phase between ears of the noise or signal. Using these stimuli in an imaging study would allow the isolation and focus on the small differences between conditions. \n\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) imaging have been used to locate neural regions associated with auditory tasks, by comparing sequential image intensity values in relationship with changes in an auditory condition. In the case of H 0  PET the changes in image intensity values are related to regional cerebral blood flow, in the case of BOLD fMRI the changes are due to changes in the oxygenation of the hemoglobin. Herein, we use the term “activation” to refer to a neural region which has statistically significant differences in image values for one condition versus another. Dichotic listening using consonant-vowel and musical-instrument stimuli together with the effect of attention was investigated by Hugdahl et al.  –  using  O PET, which measured changes in oxygen utilization. This was followed by fMRI work which typically used dichotic word or syllable stimuli  – . Budd et al.   used dichotic noise stimuli with varying levels of interaural correlation. Chait et al.   used MEG to study Huggins pitch (a dichotic pitch paradigm) and iterated ripple noise (a diotic pitch paradigm). Hall and Plack  ,   and Barker et al.   used fMRI to study these same stimuli and found activations in the auditory cortex. Puschmann et al.   used tones in noise (NπS0), Huggins pitch, binaural band pitch and Nπ noise, and also found pitch related activations in the auditory cortex. Ernst et al.   found regions that were mainly sensitive to the signal to noise ratio within and adjacent to lateral Heschl’s gryrus. A follow up study found regions in the auditory cortex related to co-modulation masking release  . \n\nIn the present exploratory investigation, we postulate that listeners will have a regionally different neural activation in response to the MLD-dichotic conditions (e.g., N0Sπ) than to the MLD-reference (e.g., N0S0) conditions. Specifically, we will compare a listener’s BOLD level response to each of the MLD dichotic conditions: NπS0, N0Sπ, N0SL (noise in-phase, signal left ear only), and N0SR (noise in-phase, signal right ear only), to the BOLD level response while listening to the MLD reference condition N0S0 (i.e. NπS0 vs. N0S0, N0Sπ vs. N0S0, etc.). Because the present study is intended to be exploratory, we hypothesize, for the purposes of our analysis, that any brain voxel could show activation differences between MLD conditions. However, based on related MLD animal studies, we expect differences to be in more rostral regions of the central auditory nervous system, including the IC and AC. Furthermore, we conjecture there will be cortical differences in a listener’s BOLD response between the MLD dichotic conditions NπS0 and N0Sπ based on the commonly observed behavioral and EEG differences observed   between these MLD conditions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe study protocol was approved by the University at Buffalo, Health Science IRB; all participants gave their informed written consent prior to auditory screening. Participants had to meet the following criteria: be between the ages of 18 and 45 years; be right-handed; have pure tone hearing thresholds of 25 dB HL or better for frequencies 250 Hz - 8000 Hz for each ear; and have a N0Sπ - N0S0 MLD of 10 dB or greater. Participants underwent screening and MLD threshold testing in a sound booth within a week prior to MRI testing. \n\n\n### Auditory Testing \n  \nSignal threshold testing was performed in a sound booth for conditions: N0S0, N0Sπ, NπS0, N0SL, and N0SR. Threshold determination used a forced-choice design with three one-second length noise segments which were separated by.5 seconds and presented at 75 dB SPL. Participants had to determine which segment also included an enveloped 500 Hz tone as the signal. Testing started with a signal level of 85 dB SPL. This signal level stayed the same until the participant was able to correctly identify the signal two times in a row, or was unable to correctly identify the signal once. If the participant was unable to detect the signal, the signal level increased; if the participant was able to detect the signal in two successive trials at the same signal level, the signal level decreased. Seven direction changes were used. Step sizes between level changes were 8, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2 dB. The average of the last two reversals was used as the threshold. MLDs were calculated by subtracting N0S0 threshold from the thresholds found for: N0Sπ, NπS0, N0SL, and N0SR. Participants additionally underwent a forced choice signal lateralization test, and identified randomly presented 1 second segments of N0SL, N0S0, or N0SR, as \"Signal Left\", \" Signal Both\", or \"Signal Right\" for 30 presentations. The tone signal was presented 3 dB above the participant's N0S0 signal threshold. \n\n\n### Stimuli Construction \n  \nConditions were created by summing together noise and signal segments using MATLAB (Natick, MA). The signal was a 500 Hz sine signal, presented in bursts lasting 250 ms with a 25 ms rise and fall time, presented every 500 ms. The noise for the presentations was created by sampling a very long duration of noise (approx. 10 minutes) created and filtered using a 400–600 Hz band-pass, equi-ripple finite impulse response (FIR) filter, with order 1064, having 50 dB attenuation +− 100 Hz, designed with the Filter Design and Analysis Tool in Matlab. The program used calibration values of noise and signal intensity as a program parameter. Calibration measurements were made using a Larson Davis System 824, with acoustic coupler AEC101 IEC 318 (LD-SLM) of individual noise and signal segments. The signal and noise were summed together by randomly choosing a point in the band-passed noise segment, and searching forward for 2 ms (one cycle of the signal) to determine the starting point that would give the highest correlation between the noise and signal. After selecting a starting point, one second each of noise and signal were summed together for the sound booth stimuli, and eight-second segments were summed together for the scanner stimuli. The noise used a.1 second ramp filter at the start and end of each stimulus. \n\n\n### Acoustic Calibration \n  \nMRI-compatible headphones from Resonance Technologies, Inc. (Northridge, CA) were tested and levels calibrated using the LD-SLM. Signal phase between ears was checked using a single cycle sine wave as input to the headphones and was measured through the LD-SLM with an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS3012). Based on our findings, the stimuli were corrected in software to compensate for reversal of phase (180°) by the headphones. The scanner headphone acoustic output was evaluated with a Stanford Research System Model SR785, Dynamic Signal Analyzer (DSA), to determine the frequency response to the noise and signal. In response to the 400–600 Hz band-pass noise, resonances in the acoustic system showed a maximum peak in the 600–700 Hz range. For this reason, a shortened version of the MLD testing was also performed with the scanner headphones to ensure that subjects had an MLD response with scanner headphones. The pure tone signal response of the headphones was also measured with the DSA, and didn't reveal any problems. Prior to each scanning session, presentation levels were verified using a Radio Shack model 33–2055 sound level meter, which was mounted to a fabricated coupler. Sennheiser 280 Pro headphones were used for the screening, and underwent similar testing and calibration. Correct phase of signal was observed between ears, as was a steep drop off below 400 Hz and above 600 Hz for the noise. \n\n\n### Scanner Room MLD Testing \n  \nMLD threshold testing in the scanner room using scanner headphones followed the same procedure used in the screening (described above), but used only five direction changes, and only two conditions: N0S0 and N0Sπ. This testing was used only for assessment of MLD effect size in the scanner environment. Signal level for fMRI presentation was determined separately using longer length segments such that participants could barely identify that the signal was present for the N0S0 condition, but could not identify if the signal was present 2 dB lower. This signal level was fixed for all stimulus conditions. \n\n\n### Scanner Conditions \n  \nScanner conditions were \"NoStim\" (No Stimuli), N0, Nπ, S0, Sπ, N0S0, N0Sπ, NπS0, N0SL, and N0SR. Each presentation lasted for eight seconds. Presentations followed one second of quiet, which was inserted to prevent an adaptation effect between scanner coil noise and stimuli. The scanner TA (acquisition time) was 3 seconds, resulting in 12 seconds between the start of consecutive conditions. Four sessions were collected for each subject. Each session presented each of the 10 conditions six times. The conditions were presented in randomly-chosen permutations with the provision that neighboring permutation end and start conditions could not be the same. Prior to each session, participants were instructed to \"listen for the signal\". After each session, participants were asked whether they were still comfortable. Each session included three frames prior to the stimuli presentation, which were discarded. \n\n\n### Scanning Parameters \n  \nMR Imaging was performed using a GE 3T Signa Excite HD 12.0 Twin Speed 8-channel scanner (General Electric, GE, Milwaukee, WI) with a maximum slew rate of 150 mT/m/ms and maximum gradient amplitude in each orthogonal plane of 50 mT/m (zoom mode). An 8-channel head coil (In Vivo Corporation, Orlando, FL) was used for all acquisitions. A high-resolution 3D fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) scan was collected at a voxel size of 1×1×1 mm (acquisition matrix of 256×256, FOV 25.6 cm). 174 locations per slab were acquired, 1 mm thick, ensuring whole brain coverage. Echo/repetition time for the 3D FSPGR scan were TE/TR = 4.1/9.1 ms, flip angle = 20, 1 average, and bandwidth 19.23 kHz (150 Hz/px). 2D sparse functional imaging was performed with a TE = 35 ms. and group delay  = 9 seconds, which provided nine seconds of “quiet”, during which the stimuli was presented, followed by TA = 3 seconds during which the fMRI planes were actively acquired  ,  . 27 slices 4 mm thick were acquired with no gap, using a 128×128 acquisition matrix, and FOV = 24.0 cm, for an in-plane resolution of 1.9 mm×1.9 mm. \n\n\n### Processing \n  \nDicom image files were converted to NIfTI format using dcm2nii (MRIcron;  ). Realignment and co-registration of functional images to the participants T1 weighted image was performed using SPM5 ( ). Segmentation was performed on the participant's T1 image, which provided spatial normalization parameters for transforming the co-registered functional images into the coordinate system of the provided SPM templates. Scans were smoothed using an 8×8×8 mm Gaussian kernel. After using SPM5 to create the general linear model including all conditions for each session, SPMd   was used to identify outlying scans. Next, a first -level SPM analysis was then performed for each subject which included all four sessions, but excluded scans identified by SPMd as having greater than 30 times the median number of outlier voxels, or which had more than 1 mm total motion from the previous scan. The first-level analysis provides separate images showing activation for each individual for each contrast. A second-level analysis was then performed using the contrast images produced for each individual in order to make statistical parametric maps. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nFive female and five male participants were recruited. All met the inclusion criteria described above for the study. Male and female participants matched in age within 2 years and ranged in age from 23 to 43 years; the mean female and males ages were 29.2 and 29.8 years, respectively. After each scan session, all participants were alert when spoken with, and reported being comfortable. Each participant completed the full scanning session. \n\n### Auditory Testing Results \n  \nMean threshold values for N0S0, N0Sπ, NπS0, N0SL, and N0SR measured during the auditory testing performed in the sound booth were 68.6, 54.2, 56.4 59.0, and 59.0 dB SPL, respectively. Hence, the mean MLD for N0Sπ –N0S0 and NπS0– N0S0 were 14.4 and 12.2 dB, respectively. Mean MLDs for N0SL and N0SR were both 9.6 dB, but participants had up to an 8 dB imbalance between these two conditions. The N0SR-N0S0 MLD for participant 4 was zero. The mean N0Sπ - N0S0 MLD measured using scanner headphones was 11.4 dB, with minimum and maximum values of 4 and 16 dB. Individual MLD thresholds are given in  , a comparison of the MLD thresholds measured in the soundbooth and scanner room is given in  . \n   Thresholds (measured in dB SPL) for detection of 500 Hz sinusoid signal in 75 dB SPL, 400–600 Hz band-pass noise, with all measurements made in the sound booth.         A comparison between MLD condition measurements (in dB SPL) made in the sound booth and scanner room of the thresholds for detection of 500 Hz sinusoid signal in 75 dB SPL, 400–600 Hz band-pass noise.      \nFor the lateralization testing, four participants had a 90% success rate or better, and three participants had a 30% success rate or worse (i.e. less than expected by chance). However, in less than 4% of responses did participants mistake the signal presented to the left as right, or vice versa. Since the signal was presented at 3 dB above the N0S0 threshold, it was on average ∼13 dB above the thresholds for N0SL and N0SR. Individual lateralization results are provided in  . \n   Individual volunteer’s confusion matrices for identifying whether the signal was presented to the “Left”, “Both”, or “Right” ear(s).      \n\n### MRI Results \n  \nIn   we describe all second-level analyses that meet the strict criterion of significance p<.05 correcting for family-wise error (FWE), and regions that meet a weaker \"trending\" criterion of p<.1, FWE, which for comparison was roughly equivalent to p<.00001 uncorrected, for voxel-wise comparisons. \n   Table of SPM activations for study contrasts.        \n\n### MLD: N0Sπ vs. N0S0 \n  \nSecond-level random effects analysis revealed a small region reaching voxel-wise significance in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) for the contrast N0Sπ - N0S0. The opposite contrast N0S0 - N0Sπ showed a 1608 mm  region of significant activation, located in and around the right insula. \n\n\n### MLD: NπS0 vs. N0S0 \n  \nSecond-level analysis did not reveal any regions reaching significance using FWE correction for the contrast NπS0– N0S0. The maximum occurred within the LIFG, p<.0001, uncorrected, which we include in our   because of its similar location to the N0Sπ –N0S0 activation. Likewise the opposite contrast, N0S0-NπS0, did not reveal any significant or trending regions. The largest threshold region was located in left insula and planum polare (p = .167, FWE, cluster-wise). \n\n\n### N0Sπ vs. NπS0 \n  \nThe contrast NπS0 - N0Sπ had a widely-distributed set of regions which reached significance: left insula, right superior frontal gyrus, a region on the right side of the corpus callosum, and the right pulvinar thalami; three of these regions had significance p<.01, FWE, cluster-wise. Additionally, the right insula met our weaker cluster significance threshold of p<.1, FWE. Statistical parametric maps showing the (group) activation in the corpus callosum and pulvinar thalamus are shown in   and  . There were no regions which reached or approached significance for the contrast N0Sπ - NπS0. \n   Two separate activation regions are seen within the corpus callosum for the group comparison using the 2  level contrast NπS0 - N0Sπ, threshold p<.001, uncorrected for family-wise error (FWE).  \nBecause the activation maps have been smoothed at 8×8×8 mm FWHM, there may appear to be an overlap of the activation with the ventricle seen on the high resolution T1 image, which we did not attempt to mask. The statistics for this cluster is an indication that there exists at least one point of activation within the cluster with true significance (p<.01, FWE, cluster-wise for the larger region,  ). Obviously, the true source of activation would be in the tissue region, as the region of significance would likely be near voxels with the highest t-scores, which are located within the corpus callosum. The large activation seen in the L. insula is also cluster-wise significant (p<.01). All conditions were presented using random permutation ordering to prevent possible cyclic responses or habituation effects being mix with the contrast of conditions. Furthermore, SPMd was used to prevent any possible influence of outliers or motion. \n  \n\n### Lateralization \n  \nSPM results for conditions involving N0SR and N0SL did not exhibit clear patterns. The contrasts N0SL vs. N0S0, N0SR vs. N0S0, and N0SL vs. N0SR had no regions of activation. The most notable results arose from the contrast N0SR – N0Sπ, which showed large activations in and around the left and right caudate nucleus. Individual participant results for contrasts involving N0SL and N0SR vs. N0S0 appeared inconsistent. We believe this might be due to differences in subjects' lateralization ability. To test this belief, an analysis using a participant's overall lateralization success (percentage correct) as a covariate was attempted, as was limiting the analysis to only participants who performed well on the lateralization task. The results of both post-hoc analyses did not reach significance, and likely suffered from limited power. \n\n\n### Other \n  \nWe also present comparisons between three noise-with-signal conditions versus the corresponding noise-only conditions: N0S0 vs. N0, N0Sπ vs. N0, and NπS0 vs. Nπ. We found no activations between N0S0 and N0, in either direction. The opposite contrast, N0-N0Sπ, yielded two regions: one in the post-central gyrus that reached significance, and the other in the right STG that approached significance. The contrast NπS0-Nπ revealed two regions that approached or reached significance: LIFG (similar in location to the contrasts NπS0-N0S0 and N0Sπ –N0S0), and right pulvinar thalamus. There were no activations for the opposite contrast, Nπ -NπS0. \n\nWe hypothesized, but did not observe, activation in the primary auditory cortex with the N0Sπ – N0S0 contrast. In  , we show the number of participants that presented increased activation in the R. STG (SPM T >1.0), as well as the number of participants showing decreased activation (SPM T <1.0). The cross hairs mark a location in the right STG where three participants exhibited an increase, three a decrease, and four had no change for the contrast N0Sπ – N0S0. For the N0Sπ-NoStim contrast, a search of voxels with p<.01 (uncorrected) reveals a cluster of 3012 mm  in the left STG, which is cluster-wise significant, p = .035, FWE. There was a cluster located in the right STG, which did not reach significance with peak spm t value  = 5.5 and extent size of 1620 mm . For the contrast N0S0– NoStim there was a cluster with extent size 1207 mm  and peak spm t = 5.19 in the left STG, and a cluster with extent size 1187 mm  with peak spm t = 5.44 in the right STG, however neither cluster was statistically significant accounting for FWE. As a check of the processing, the contrasts S0– NoStim was examined for all subjects using a height threshold of p = .01, uncorrected. All but two subjects had a peak spm t value >3 located in both the left and right STG, with peak spm t = 11.5. While no regions were significant for the second level analysis, there was a cluster of size 1100 mm  with peak spm t = 5.8 located in the left STG, and a cluster with extent size 2185 mm  and peak spm t = 8.12 located in the right STG, using a height threshold of p<.01, uncorrected. Hence for our tested Stim vs NoStim contrasts, we consistently observed clusters of voxels with moderately high spm t values located in the STG, as would be expected in response to auditory stimuli. \n   Activation seen in the right pulvinar thalamus for the group comparison 2  level contrast NπS0 - N0Sπ, threshold p<.001, uncorrected for FWE.

Right image: Image of number of participants with an increase in activation for N0Sπ – N0S0. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur study used functional imaging to search nearly the entire brain for neural correlates to the MLD. We did not find support for our hypothesis of activation associated with MLD (comparisons: NπS0 vs. N0S0, N0Sπ vs. N0S0, N0SL vs. N0S0 and N0SR vs. N0SR) in more rostral regions of the central auditory nervous system, such as the IC and AC, which was based on animal model work  – . We do not rule out the involvement of these regions, but speculate that the functional anatomical variability of the AC prevented detection using voxel-wise statistics family-wise error corrected across the whole brain. However, our results do indicate clear neural correlates of the MLD in the insula, pulvinar thalamus, and corpus callosum. We interpret this activation pattern as consistent with the Kimura model for REA for speech processing  , and syllable-based dichotic-listening studies  – ,  – . \n\nThe main assumptions of Kimura's model are: 1) auditory information is principally processed in the temporal lobe contralateral to the ear of presentation; 2) the left hemisphere is more specialized for language/speech processing than the right (in particular for right-handed participants); 3) there is a decussation of auditory information from the right hemisphere across the corpus callosum to the left hemisphere (which is specialized for the processing of speech stimuli) for further processing; and 4) the ipsilateral pathway can be suppressed by the contralateral pathway  ,  . \n\nAssumption 1 is firmly established in the literature  , but is not addressed by our data, as all of our conditions (except the NoStim condition) are presented to both ears. Assumption 2 is supported by our data, as there was a significant cluster for the contrast N0Sπ -NoStim with extent size 3012 mm  which reached significance within the left STG, whereas a cluster about half the size located in the right STG did not reach significance. The activation in the LIFG for the MLD contrasts: N0Sπ - N0S0, NπS0– N0S0, and NπS0-Nπ also fits with the left lateralization proposed by the “what” portion of the “what”/“where” model  – , which postulates that the neural processing of information will follow different pathways, depending on whether it is being processed based on recognition or localization. While the Kimura model is for speech, and we used tonal (500 Hz) stimuli, it is not unreasonable to expect a left-hemisphere dominant response, since the stimuli were not continuous but presented in short 250 ms enveloped bursts every half second. The left AC has been shown to respond well to temporal changes  , as would be required in the tracking of formants. We did not find significant regional activation in the right STG, for any of the contrasts using the “NoStim\" condition or any other evidence to argue for right hemisphere dominance. \n\nActivation of the corpus callosum for the contrast (NπS0– N0Sπ) gives evidence of inter-hemispheric communication (part of assumption 3 of the Kimura model). While less common, corpus callosum activation has been previously observed, including in studies that involved stimulation requiring high inter-hemispheric communication  – . We were careful to guard against artifacts, and we believe this white matter activation to reflect a true processing path. The two contrasted conditions are similar perceptually compared to the other stimuli, and we did not observe any relative motion of the subjects between conditions. While we employed standard SPM realignment methods, we also eliminated scans that had more than 1 mm total motion from the previous scan. The conditions were presented in an order determined by random permutations, and hence all conditions were balanced in being presented both early and late in the presentation sequence. The contrasts in this study were all “within” subject, hence we do not expect an artifact due to spatial normalization differences, such as could be found if comparing between groups. Finally, we used SPMd to eliminate scans that had the possibility of being a transient, which was a cautionary step most others do not take, likely because of the increased difficulty of performing the analysis. \n\nWe note that differences between our MLD conditions NπS0 and N0Sπ imply an underlying activation difference between at least one of the conditions and the control condition, N0S0. The noise portion of the stimuli has a wider bandwidth and a (generally) higher overall SPL than the sine-wave portion. Accordingly, we speculate that metabolic differences in processing are largely influenced by changes in the noise component of our stimuli. We conjecture that information of the noise signal for NπS0 crosses the corpus callosum, going from right to left hemisphere. We believe this ipsilateral (double crossing) noise signal may combine with the matching contralateral signal in the left insula, with a net suppression effect. Plausible evidence supporting this belief is seen by the activity decrease in the left insula for NπS0 compared to N0S0. \n\nIn contrast, we conjecture that the noise portion of N0Sπ is suppressed earlier in the processing chain, perhaps in the right insula or pulvinar thalamus, which would support the reduced activity seen in the corpus callosum (contrast: NπS0– N0Sπ), and the large decrease in activation (1500 mm ) in the right insula (contrast: N0S0 - N0Sπ). Furthermore, we believe that the resulting combination of the noise signal with the ipsilateral auditory signal in the left insula is reduced as a result of the diminished inter-hemispheric transfer. Diagrams of our hypothesized release from masking models for the MLD conditions NπS0 and N0Sπ are shown in   and  . While dichotic listening is generally believed to involve the transfer of auditory information across the corpus callosum, studies which have examined the effects of surgical sectioning of the corpus callosum indicate that primary auditory pathways are more towards the caudal end than the activation we found  –  This could indicate that the contrast reflects a decrease in activity for the N0S0 condition. This is consistent with previous findings, where one subject   had an improved score for a left ear attention after the anterior sectioning of the corpus callosum. If nothing else, the contrast difference between NπS0– N0Sπ, shows that all dichotic stimuli are not treated similarly. The surgical studies used dichotic speech pairs (numbers or constant vowels). We suspect that auditory signals cross in the caudal portion of the corpus callosum, but the   differences   between conditions were not great enough to be observed. Again, white matter activation is rare, and the reason we found a difference may only be because we are observing both a slight increase and decrease compared to the control condition N0S0. \n   Diagram showing theorized release from masking processing paths for NπS0.  \nWhen the noise portion of the stimuli from the left ear arrives in the left hemisphere after crossing the corpus callosum, the subsequent combined noise component after mixing with matching but opposite-phase noise from the right ear is suppressed, because the combining signals lack coincidence. \n     Diagram showing theorized release from masking processing paths for N0Sπ.  \nWhen (if) the noise signal from the left ear arrives in the left hemisphere, after crossing the corpus callosum, it has already been greatly suppressed. The site of the original suppression could be at the right pulvinar thalamus or insula of the right hemisphere. \n  \nAssumption 4 of Kimura’s model states that the ipsilateral pathway is suppressed; which has empirical support from the study by Pollmann et al.  , who found that patients with lesions in the posterior part of the corpus callosum showed a nearly 100% REA. Our data is not inconsistent with this, but neither does it support this element of the model. \n\n### Dichotic Listening \n  \nThe thalamus has been proposed as a gating system for speech (and possibly other stimuli) to be sent to more rostral brain regions  ,  , based on dichotic-listening experiments with patients undergoing stereothalamotomy. A dichotic-listening study by Fitch et al.   found that lesions in the posterior thalamus inhibited the processing of auditory stimuli, including attending to stimuli presented to a particular ear. If the pulvinar thalamus is acting as a gating mechanism in our study, we propose that it is triggered when the signal is present in the stimuli. The right pulvinar was observed as part of the large activation pattern for the contrast NπS0 - N0Sπ (  and  ). The results also revealed activation in the pulvinar thalamus for the contrast NπS0– Nπ (p = .025, FWE, cluster-wise), which gives another example of its responsiveness to the presence of the signal in background noise. As a final example, if the signal is removed from the contrast of MLD conditions NπS0-N0Sπ (which had strong activations), the resulting contrast, Nπ-N0, has no regions with significant activation. The reverse contrast, N0-Nπ, yielded a very different activation pattern, with significant activation found in the left and right angular gyrus, right cingular gyrus, right posterior cingulate, right medial gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus. \n\n\n### Lateralization \n  \nOur study's focus was on finding neural correlates associated with the MLDs, and we have reported on the primary focus of the study. In addition to the MLD conditions N0Sπ and NπS0, we used the MLD conditions N0SL and N0SR. These conditions have an interesting place in the hierarchy of the MLD conditions, since starting from the N0SL or N0SR condition, the addition of the signal in-phase to the opposite ear becomes N0S0, or becomes N0Sπ if the added signal is π radians out-of-phase. Based on pilot testing, we believed that participants would be able to distinguish between the signal being presented to the left, right or both ears, amid the noise background. \n\nLateralization testing with MLDs is not normally performed, and has only infrequently been reported in the literature  . The results of the lateralization testing, which was only performed during the screening session (in the soundbooth) were very mixed, with four participants performing very well, and three very poorly (slightly less than expected by chance). Yet, overall, in less than 4% of responses did participants mistake the signal presented to the left as right, or vice versa. The signal was presented at 3 dB above the N0S0 threshold, and was on average ∼13 dB above the thresholds for N0SL and N0SR. The thresholds for N0SL and N0SR were also mixed. For example, one subject’s MLD for N0SR was 0 dB. By basing the signal level on the N0S0 condition, we effectively made the lateralization harder on those who may have had a more effective strategy for N0S0 signal detection. The remainder of MLD behavioral testing was unremarkable. For example, we observed N0Sπ was roughly 2 dB better than NπS0  , which was roughly 2.5 dB better than N0SL or N0SR. Based on the lateralization results, we will assume that at least some of the participants were unable to lateralize the location of the signal while in the scanner. The perceptual difference for a signal presented in-phase and out-of-phase diminishes at levels above threshold  , therefore we did not consider a higher signal level. \n\nLack of a strong finding in our hypothesized regions of AC and IC has some support from previous studies. We believe our results to be consistent with a study by Hall and Plack  ,  , which used dichotic stimuli to investigate Huggins pitch, where the perception of pitch was created by linearly changing the phase between ears through 1 cycle of a small band centered around 200 Hz of broadband noise. In their study, Huggins pitch was contrasted against a “just-noise” condition, whereas we contrasted our MLD conditions against N0S0, which has a detectable pitch due to the presence of the (audible) in-phase 500 Hz stimulus. As both MLD and non-MLD conditions had a detectable tonal stimulus in our study, we expect our ‘pitch’ vs. control contrast to be smaller than that found by Hall and Plack. In a study using 16 participants, Hall and Plack had comparisons between pitch and noise that did not identify a single pitch center common to all listeners   (pg. 579). However, as an indication of the between-subject anatomical variability of the auditory cortex, they were able to find regions sensitive to pitch stimuli in most subjects, but in slightly varying locations. Hence, our lack of finding any MLD-related activation in the AC is not surprising. In our study we had fewer subjects, and we limited ourselves to FWE statistics corrected for the whole brain as a search region. The advantage of our approach is that we were able to find regions we didn’t originally specify (e.g. pulvinar thalamus); our disadvantage is that our analysis methods are less sensitive than studies that limit their search to the auditory cortex. \n\nThe MLD conditions, when compared to the no stimulus condition (N0S0 - NoStim and N0Sπ - NoStim), only showed one cluster which was significant, which was located in the left STG for contrast N0Sπ – NoStim. However, for both contrasts, there were clusters in both the left and right STG with peak spm t value greater than 5 and size greater 1100 mm , when using a height threshold of p = .01, uncorrected. Examination of individual results for contrast S0– NoStim showed that there was large variability in responses between individuals ranging from two subjects having only a weak activation in either the left or right STG to one subject that had peak t values greater than 11 (bilaterally). We believe that the weakness of these contrasts is likely the result of anatomical variability. Also, given that our instructions to the subject was to “listen for the signal”, different subjects may have treated the absence of stimuli ambiguously  . We’ll note that we consider our true control condition for the study to be N0S0, and that the “NoStim” condition was intended primarily to test the processing path. We believe that our finding for N0S0– NoStim in which the signal portion (S0) is barely audible, is similar to that by Hart et al.  , who on a larger data set (12 participants versus our study’s 10 participants, 28 repetitions vs. our study’s 24, and using a presentation level of 90 dB SPL compared to our presentation level of 75 dB SPL), reported no activation for stationary unmodulated (i.e. constant) tones. \n\nOur study compared conditions that were the same in intensity, spectrum, and duration, and we expected neural activation differences because of the perceptual differences. Yet the conditions used in the contrasts with the two largest activation patterns, NπS0 - N0Sπ and N0 - Nπ, are close enough that perceptually they may be hard for some to distinguish, in the same way that some may not recognize stereo speakers or headphones as being wired out of phase. Our rationale for comparing NπS0 and N0Sπ was based on the findings of Wong and Stapells  , who found an auditory steady state response MLD for modulation frequencies of 7 or 13 Hz for the N0Sπ versus N0S0 comparison, but not for the NπS0 vs. N0S0 contrast. That we find greater activation for NπS0 than N0Sπ, yet the auditory evoked response MLD was seen only for N0Sπ, could be due to the auditory evoked response being sensitive to the signal portion of the stimulus (i.e., phase locked to the envelope of the signal), while the fMRI finding was driven by the noise portion of the stimulus, as we previously argued. \n\n\n### Strengths and Weaknesses \n  \nOur design approach was purposely broad (using 10 conditions) and exploratory in nature. Utilizing fMRI, we were able to search nearly the entire brain for activation patterns in response to MLD conditions. The benefit of our broad approach was that we achieved strong and interesting results outside of our stated study hypothesis, while within our SPM analysis hypotheses. We opted against the use of a button press for monitoring a participant’s attention in order to avoid potential conflicting neural activations; participants were instead instructed to listen for the signal. We believe this approach was sufficient for our set of attentive and well-intentioned participants. The participants, as observed through conversation with the scanners communication system, remained alert throughout the study. SPMd was used as a final guard to identify and eliminate scans which may have been influenced by system transients or brief, unexpected participant behavior or focus. \n\nA sparse MRI sequence allowed the stimuli to be presented during periods of relative quiet, and provided a better environment for listening for the modulated signal in the noise. We included a one second gap of ‘no stimulus’ between the end of the scanner data collection and the presentation to preserve a clear and consistent onset of the stimulus, and to prevent an auditory adaptation effect  ,   from the scanner noise. Since the band-passed noise component of the stimuli and 500 Hz tone are correlated, we went through the additional step of searching through 2 ms of the noise, to find the noise starting position that gave the maximum correlation, for a consistent presentation strategy  . The N0S0 threshold with the scanner headphones in the scanner room was approximately 2 dB better (lower) than in the sound booth. The lower threshold is likely related to a peak in the noise spectrum above 600 Hz for the scanner headphone, which implies a lower overall noise level near 500 Hz for the scanner vs. sound booth headphones. Also, this indicates that the use of a sound booth isn't critical, likely due to the 75 dB SPL background noise masking much of the environmental background noise. \n\nOur study enrolled 10 participants, and was limited by resources. This allowed sufficient power for our primary hypothesizes and contrasts, as many of our reported regions had p<.01, FWE, cluster-wise. Our analysis of a hypothesized region in auditory cortex showed that some participants had increased activations while some others had decreased activations. We believe this indicates that a moderate increase in the number of participants would not have appreciably improved our findings for our hypotheses. However, while we approached the analysis globally, a regionally-specific analysis of the auditory cortex (which also accounted for anatomical variability of the auditory cortex) may have been able to find significance. While we are satisfied with not using a button press for our main hypothesizes, we recommend that future work, if it focuses on lateralization, include a button press. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nOur findings reveal a network of neural correlates associated with the MLD (that are outside of the previous focus of MLD research) which involves the pulvinar thalamus, the insulae, and a neural process that crosses the corpus callosum. These findings, in particular the involvement of the pulvinar thalamus, fit with the dichotic listening research, and are congruent with the proposed model of Kimura. \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"af13c480b2e8a681bcef03b6a52de558"}

However, when wrong choices could lead to social punishment, such as blame, people might try to improve their performance by minimizing sub-optimal choices, which could be achieved by increasing the subjective cost of errors, thereby globally reducing decision noise or reducing an uncertainty-induced component of decision noise. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, 46 participants performed a choice task in which the probability of a correct choice with a given cue and the conditional probability of blame feedback (by making an incorrect choice) changed continuously. By comparing computational models of behaviour, we found that participants optimized their performance by preferentially reducing a component of decision noise associated with uncertainty. Simultaneously, expecting blame significantly deteriorated participants’ mood. Model-based fMRI analyses and dynamic causal modelling indicate that the optimization mechanism based on the expectation of being blamed would be controlled by a neural circuit centred on the right medial prefrontal cortex. These results show novel behavioural and neural mechanisms regarding how humans optimize uncertain decisions under the expectation of being blamed. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn our workplace, we make many decisions between options with uncertain values. If we fail to make a good decision, we might face a socially undesirable situation—such as being blamed by a boss. Therefore, although it could be hard to make a good decision because of uncertainty, we may become more deliberate and expend more effort to enhance the probability of optimal choice in this situation. We occasionally encounter this kind of stressful situation that might enhance decision performance at that moment but would make us feel bad. \n\nThe motivation to avoid negative outcomes might enhance task performance through several mechanisms, including increasing attention to the task ( ) and enhancing working memory function ( ). Furthermore, the performance-enhancing effect by punishment has been thought to involve an increase in catecholamine level ( ). However, the behavioural and neural mechanisms that an agent uses to optimize an uncertain decision-making process to avoid a highly probable social punishment such as blame if their decision is wrong and how these kinds of socially stressful situation influences out mood have not been investigated. \n\nA candidate mechanism of behaviour under uncertainty that could be controlled under threat to optimize behaviour is by reducing uncertainty-driven error in their action, and an unnecessary exploration could be a kind of that error. Exploration is the choice of an option that does not have maximum value among all options in the current state ( ;  ), which could be either ‘directed’ to more uncertain options or ‘random’ ( ). Gershman and colleagues derived trial-by-trial uncertainties according to a Bayesian model of decision-making, and they showed that humans use both kinds of uncertainty-induced exploration ( ). Especially, they suggested that a total uncertainty induces a decision noise (uncertainty-induced decision noise [UDN]), which subsequently causes a random exploration ( ). Because both exploration strategies help an individual obtain information about the environment, it might also benefit a long-term cumulative reward in some situations ( ). However, if the uncertainties of every option are the same and an agent knows the outcomes of both selected and unselected options, exploration would be unnecessary because it does not maximize information gain or the reward; thus, choosing the option with the maximum value would be an optimal choice. We confined the situation regarding uncertain decisions to this type of situation to simplify our question about optimizing an uncertain decision under threat. In this situation, because uncertainties among options are the same, an uncertainty-directed exploration would not exist. However, an increase in total uncertainty would increase the decision noise, causing an unnecessary random exploration, which is an error in this case that might decrease the accuracy of the choice. Therefore, we hypothesized that controlling the sub-optimal choice (error) driven by UDN might help an agent make a more accurate choice when the wrong choice is likely to result in undesirable blame. Furthermore, we expected that blame in this situation would influence not only behaviour control under uncertainty but also people’s negative mood. \n\nTo test this hypothesis, we designed a task with a choice between two options whose uncertainty changes during the task and both the outcomes of selected and unselected options are fully knowable (Figure  A). Importantly, participants received blame with high or low probabilities when they made a wrong choice, and this conditional probability changed between blocks of trials. Note that, we used blame as an aversive stimulus that motivates one to avoid it which is similar to physical pain but encounters more frequently in our social life. However, our aim was not to compare both kinds of painful stimuli in this study. We predicted that participants would infer how likely they would be blamed by making a wrong choice and would control UDN to make a more accurate choice when blame was highly likely while their mood is negatively influenced. Note that the term ‘uncertainty’ used in our study indicates an ‘estimation uncertainty’ or ‘information uncertainty’ resulting from an insufficient estimation of the value ( ). In our case, uncertainty is derived from an imperfect estimation of the probabilistic association between a cue and a ‘correct’ outcome ( ). These hypothesis were tested by modelling participants’ behaviour and mood during the task using the novel hierarchal Bayesian reinforcement learning model. In this model, an agent infers both about (i) which option is likely to be correct and how such belief is uncertain and (ii) how it is likely to be blamed if one makes the wrong decision and these two kinds of inferences jointly influences the decision. \n  \n(A) Experimental paradigm. Two Tibetan character cues were presented, and cues were associated with a ‘correct’ outcome with the probability of   P   and 1−  P   each. This probability   P   changes between blocks of trials. If participants made a wrong choice, a blame composed of an angry face and swear words appeared probabilistically. (B) Probability structure of the task. Left: correct probability (Correct prob) and the conditional probability of blame given wrong choice (Blame prob) were changed between blocks of trials to change the participants’ estimation of uncertainty. Furthermore, there were high-blame blocks (grey-shaded area) and low-blame blocks. Right figure shows an example of belief trajectory regarding p(correct|cue) and p(blame|w) estimated from the CUDN model in one participant. The plot shows the similarity between the estimated belief trajectory and the designed probabilistic schedule. (C) A trajectory of good choice proportion for 20 trials after probability reversal. In both high- and low-blame blocks, good choice proportion kept increasing after the reversal. Furthermore, good choice probability was higher in the high-blame blocks than in the low-blame blocks early after reversals (about 10 trials after reversal). (D) Good choice proportion, accuracy and RT difference between high- and low-blame blocks. We compared the mean good choice proportion (left), accuracy (middle) and RT (right) between high-blame and low-blame blocks using a paired   t  -test. Good choice proportion was compared only in early trials after correct probability reversal. Participants showed increased good choice proportion, accuracy and RT within the high-blame blocks. The face used in this figure is different from the one that was used in the experiment to avoid using real human image in the figure (the face in this figure was generated by FaceGen Modeller ( )). \n  \nIn order to identify a neural mechanism of such behavioural optimization under threat, model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses and dynamic causal modelling (DCM) analysis ( ) were performed. A recent study suggested the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as a candidate region for controlling strategic avoidance behaviour under threat ( ;  ). Furthermore, the mPFC implements slower, more controlled and deliberate decision-making during difficult choices ( ) and drives strategy shifts ( ). Therefore, we hypothesized that the neural circuit involving the mPFC would control the behavioural optimization process under the expectation of being blamed. Especially, we expected that such a neural circuit would also involve the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC), which is related to an uncertainty-driven exploration in the previous literature ( ). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty-six participants (32 males and 14 females, mean age of 22.61 ± 3.61 years) from the Korea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology (KAIST) volunteered for this experiment. Details of participants’ information can be found in the  . \n\n\n### Ethics statement \n  \nAll participants provided written informed consent to participate in the experiment based on sufficient explanation about the study (including blame). The study was approved by the KAIST Institutional Review Board in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Experimental task \n  \nEvery participant completed 240 trials of a choice task in which the goal was to acquire the ‘correct’ outcome as many times as possible. In every trial, two Tibetan character cues were presented, and participants were asked to choose one (Figure  A). Cues were probabilistically associated with either a ‘correct’ outcome or a ‘wrong’ outcome, and this correct probability was reciprocal such that \n\n\n\nwhich was explicitly conveyed to participants to make the uncertainties about the correct probabilities for both cues to be equal, thus minimizing directed exploration. This probability was changed every 10–50 trials between 20/30% and 80/70% to change the participants’ estimation of the uncertainty of association probability between the cue and the correct choice (Figure  B). They failed to make a good choice (designed to have a higher probability of correct) right after probability reversal. However, their good choice probability increased through learning ( ). Independent with this correct probability, participants had to think about whether they might face a socially undesirable situation if they fail to make the right decision in the current trial. Particularly, if they made a wrong choice, they were probabilistically being blamed with an angry face and swear words. We called this type of feedback blame, and we instructed participants to regard this feedback as blame in the context of social situation, such as a blame given by their boss or superior (e.g. ‘Please try to imagine as vividly as possible that your boss yells at you because you made a wrong choice’). Participants sufficiently practised imagining this situation before starting the experiment (Figure  A). Importantly, we varied the conditional probability of the appearance of the blame feedback when participants made an incorrect choice block by block with a range from 20 to 40 trials. Thus, during some blocks of the task, the conditional probability of blame feedback was very high when the choice was wrong (80% or 90%; we designated these blocks ‘high-blame’ blocks, grey-shaded area of Figure  B), while in the other blocks, this conditional probability was low (10% or 20%; we designated these blocks ‘low-blame’ blocks). Additionally, to assess the mood of each trial, participants were instructed to rate their mood on a Likert scale ranging from −3 to 3 every eight trials after receiving secondary feedback. A total of 30 ratings were acquired from each participant. We expected that participants would implicitly or explicitly calculate the conditional probability of being blamed by making a wrong choice (we represent this subjective conditional probability of being blamed for a wrong choice of each participant as ‘p(blame|w)’), and this calculation would influence participants’ decision-making, such as encouraging participants to make more deliberate and careful choices and mood, which was revealed in the results of the post-experimental survey ( ). \n\n\n\n## Behaviour analyses \n  \n### Testing effect of blame expectation on making a better choice under uncertainty \n  \nWe first examined whether people made better choices in the trials that a wrong choice is highly likely to result blame. To define a better choice, we defined a ‘good choice’ and ‘accurate choice’. In each block, there was a cue that was designed to have a higher correct probability than other cue and choosing this better cue was defined as a ‘good’ choice of that block. For example, if a cue1 was designed to have 70% correct probability in one block (thus cue2 has 30% correct probability), that cue is the good choice of that block. An ‘accurate’ choice was defined as a choice that resulted in actual ‘Correct’ feedback at each trial. Because ‘Correct’ feedback was probabilistic given the choice, people might not get ‘Correct’ feedback even if they made a good choice. We compared a good choice proportion and mean accuracy between the high-blame blocks and low-blame blocks using the paired   t  -tests. Furthermore, because we hypothesized that an effect of blame expectation would depend on uncertainty (decreasing UDN), we also compared the good choice proportion in trials expected to have high uncertainty. Considering that uncertainty is known to be maximized after probability reversal and reduced until the next reversal because of the learning ( ), we only used the first 10 trials after a reversal of the correct probability in this test. Additional behaviour analysis can be found in the  . \n\n\n### Computational modelling of an effect of blame belief on sub-optimal decision \n  \nAfter showing that participants made better decision under uncertainty when a wrong choice is highly likely to result a blame, we designed explicit computational models that can explain the internal process of computing beliefs regarding conditional probability of the blame (p(blame|w)), and this belief subsequently influences participants’ decision. We hypothesized that uncertainty would increase the decision noise that increases a chance of sub-optimal choice and p(blame|w) would decrease this UDN, meaning an interaction effect between p(blame|w) and uncertainty on decision noise. Note that sub-optimal choice here was defined with respect to an internal belief (choosing an option that is believed to have lower correct probability than other options), making it different from a bad choice. A computational model explains this process, which was named as control of uncertainty-induced decision noise (CUDN) model (Figure  A). In this model, the parameter   determined the degree of suppression of UDN as p(blame|w) increases. Therefore, if   is large for some participants, those participants greatly suppress UDN when p(blame|w) is high compared with when p(blame|w) is low and vice versa ( ). We fitted the CUDN model to the participants’ responses and compared this model with 15 other models ( ) with random-effect Bayesian model selection (RFX-BMS) ( ;  ). A summary of the 16 models is provided in  . Other details of the computational modelling can be found in the  . \n\n\n### Model-based fMRI analysis \n  \nWe performed a model-based fMRI analysis based on the CUDN model to investigate the neural substrate of suppression of UDN under p(blame|w). We performed parametric modulation analyses using the trial-by-trial trajectories of model variables of interest for each subject as parametric modulators of a first-level general linear model (GLM) in Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) ( ). Variables of interest at the onset of the cue included trial-by-trial p(blame|w) and uncertainty that influenced decision noise in the CUDN model. Moreover, we included the trial-by-trial subjective value of the sub-optimal option (that is, subjective correct probability (p(correct|cue)) of the sub-optimal option), which induces an error (sub-optimal choice). Blame prediction error (BPE) regressor was also added as a parametric modulator at the onset of secondary feedback. Details of the methods regarding fMRI acquisition, pre-processing and parametric modulation analyses can be found in the  . \n\n\n### DCM \n  \nIn the parametric modulation analysis, we found that the bilateral mPFC was robustly activated by p(blame|w), which is consistent with our hypothesis. We expected that the mPFC would be a region that controls the UDN according to the p(blame|w), and this control process would be implemented by a dynamic change of interaction between the mPFC and the region processing sub-optimal option such as the rlPFC. To test this hypothesis, we first confirmed that their connection varies by the p(blame|w) using the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) ( ) and investigated more detailed dynamics and their relationship with UDN control process using the DCM analysis ( ). Details of the methods regarding PPI and DCM analyses can be found in the  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behaviour analyses \n  \n#### Expectation of being blamed facilitates better performance by deliberation. \n  \nOverall, people successfully followed our sophisticated probabilistic design (68.2% of good choice proportion, significantly better than chance (50%):   t  [45.00] = 15.78,   P   < 0.001), this performance was similar but slightly lower to the performance of ideal Bayesian learner (70.1%,  ). They made more good choice in the high-blame blocks only with a marginal significance (mean good choice proportion = 0.692   vs   0.673,   t  [45] = 1.76,   P   = 0.085, confidence intervals [CIs]: 0.00 to 0.04,   d   = 0.3; two-tailed paired   t  -test; Figure  D, left). However, when compared using only uncertain trials, increment of participants’ good choice proportion was small, but significant in the high-blame blocks (0.652   vs   0.614,   t  [45] = 2.02,   P   = 0.049, CIs: 0.000 to 0.077,   d   = 0.298, paired   t  -test), suggesting that an effect of blame expectation on promoting good choices might depend on the uncertainty level. Participants also choice with 57.3% accuracy (significantly better than chance, [45] = 11.45,   P   < 0.001) and they also more accurate choice in the high-blame blocks compared with the low-blame blocks (mean accuracy = 0.591   vs   0.555,   t  [45] = 4.09,   P   < 0.001, CIs: 0.02 to 0.05,   d   = 0.6; Figure  D, middle). Moreover, the mean response times (RTs) of the high-blame blocks were significantly longer than those of the low-blame blocks (mean RT = 598 ms   vs   583 ms,   Z   = 3.95,   P   < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure  D, right). Based on these results, we expected that participants made better decisions under uncertainty via deliberation when p(blame|w) was high. \n\n\n#### Computational modelling: expecting blame optimizes decision under uncertainty while negatively influences mood. \n  \nThe CUDN model was selected with a protected exceedance probability (PEP) of 0.831 among 16 candidate models, suggesting that participants were able to control the influence of subjective uncertainty on their decision depending on the belief of how they are likely to be blamed if they make an incorrect choice (Figure  C). Furthermore, the degree of suppression on UDN under high p(blame|w), which was parameterized by   had significant positive correlation with both increase in the good choice proportion (Spearman’s   = 0.384,   P   = 0.008, Figure  D) and accuracy (Spearman’s   = 0.306,   P   = 0.016, Figure  E) in high-blame blocks, meaning that participants were able to make better decision under social threat by suppressing UDN. Although p(blame|w) enabled a flexible control of the UDN, this kind of belief significantly decreased the mood of participants ( ). Although ν well explained individual differences of an effect of p(blame|w) on controlling UDN, the group average of the ν was not significantly different from the 0 (  t   = 0.93,   P   = 0.357). Finally, because the computational modelling results can be susceptible to the prior parameter setting, we performed the susceptibility analyses on the prior parameter setting of the ν. In all settings, the PEP of the CUDN model was greater than other models. However, this analysis showed that the PEP of the CUDN model changed according to the prior parameter settings and in some settings it was not sufficiently large enough ( ) (e.g. PEP = 0.531 in setting of prior mean = 0, prior variance = 1,  ), which could be the limitation of our computational modelling. \n  \n(A) Graphic description of the computational model of behavioural optimization under the expectation of being blamed. The CUDN model was composed of the following parts: the perceptual model and response model. The perceptual model is composed of two parallel learning systems—learning p(correct|cue) by the three-level hierarchical Gaussian filter (HGF) model (blue) and learning p(blame|w) by the Rescorla–Wagner (RW) model (red dashed circle). Importantly, in the response model,   represents a choice at trial k, and the  , which is the inverse temperature of the Softmax function, is a function of an estimation uncertainty   and   such that   induces decision noise and   suppresses UDN. In this graphic representation, a deterministic node and relationship are represented as dashed circles and dashed lines, respectively, while solid circles and lines represent a stochastic node and relationship. (B) Parameters of the CUDN model. In the function  , parameter   determines the participants’ degree of UDN, and   determines the participants’ degree of suppression on UDN as p(blame|w) increases. (C) Bayesian model selection results. The results of the RFX-BMS show that the CUDN model fits the participants’ behaviour better than other models (PEP = 0.831). (D) Correlation between   and good choice/accuracy enhancement. The results of correlation analysis showed that the participants with large   showed enhanced good choice proportion (left) and accuracy (right) in high-blame blocks. Note that these significant correlations also existed after removing points with values outside of 2 s.d. (rightmost 2 points) from the mean (all   P   < 0.05). \n  \n\n\n### Model-based fMRI analysis \n  \n#### The bilateral mPFC is recruited by an expectation of blame, and the bilateral rlPFC is involved in processing of sub-optimal option. \n  \nIn the parametric modulation analyses of the p(blame|w), robust activation of a bilateral mPFC cluster extending to the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the bilateral temporal pole cluster extending to the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus was observed (cluster-level whole brain familywise-error (FWE)-corrected   P  -value < 0.001 in both clusters, cluster-defining threshold [CDT]   P   = 0.001, uncorrected, Figure   and Table  ). Interestingly, in our additional conjunction analyses ( ), there was an overlapping activation within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) between p(blame|w) and subjective value difference between chosen and unchosen options ( )—where an increase of such differences are related to an increase of optimal choice (cluster-level whole brain FWE-corrected   P   < 0.001, CDT   P   = 0.001, uncorrected,  ). Therefore, we suspected that this overlap within vmPFC might support the role of p(blame|w) in decreasing decision noise. Furthermore, both p(blame|w) and the variables related to the cognitive control load (decrease of absolute value difference or RT,  ) activated dACC (cluster-level whole brain FWE-corrected   P   = 0.008, CDT   P   = 0.001, uncorrected,  ) and lPFC (cluster-level whole brain FWE-corrected   P   = 0.005, CDT   P   = 0.001, uncorrected,  ) in the conjunction analyses. Note that both regions are previously known as a part of cognitive control network ( ), and thus, we suspect that this might be related to an increase of deliberation according the level of p(blame|w). Next, a parametric modulator regarding the value (subjective correct probability) of the sub-optimal option co-varied with the blood-oxygen-level-dependentsignal of the bilateral rlPFC (cluster-level whole brain FWE-corrected   P   < 0.001, CDT   P   = 0.001, uncorrected, Figure  A,   and  ), which regions were engaged in uncertainty-driven exploration in a previous study ( ). More detailed results of parametric modulation analysis are provided in the  . \n  \nResults of the parametric modulation analysis by p(blame|w). MPFC, PCC (centre) and hippocampus (left), were activated by p(blame|w) (cluster-level whole brain FWE-corrected   P  -value < 0.001, CDT = 0.001). The blue dashed circle denotes the right mPFC used in the DCM as a region of interest (ROI). \n    \n(A) Modulation of connectivity between the right mPFC and other regions by a blame expectation. The results of the PPI analysis (upper figure) suggested that functional connectivity between the right mPFC and right rlPFC was negatively modulated as p(blame|w) increased (red dashed circle, cluster-level whole brain FWE-corrected   P  -value = 0.039, CDT = 0.05). This rlPFC cluster had large overlap with the rlPFC clusters involved in the processing of the sub-optimal option (lower figure, cluster-level whole brain FWE-corrected   P  -value < 0.001, CDT = 0.001). (B) DCM models explaining dynamics between right mPFC and rlPFC. The winning model showed the bidirectional fixed connections between the right mPFC (blue dashed circle in Figure  ) and rlPFC (red dashed circle in Figure 4A). Both connections were modulated by p(blame|w) and p(blame|w) also acted as a driving input to the mPFC. The fixed connection from the right rlPFC to the mPFC (blue arrow) was related to the degree of UDN. Moreover, p(blame|w) acted as a driving input to the right mPFC, and the effective connectivities from the right mPFC to the rlPFC as well as from the right rlPFC to the mPFC were modulated by p(blame|w) (red dashed line). The modulation of effective connectivity from the right rlPFC to the mPFC was related to the degree of UDN control via p(blame|w). \n    \nRegions activated by p(blame|w) \n  \nAAL, automated anatomical labeling; TP, temporal pole; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; STG, superior temporal gyrus. \n  \n\n#### Blame expectation negatively modulates effective connectivity from the right rlPFC to the right mPFC to suppress the UDN. \n  \nIn the PPI analysis, we found out that functional connectivity between right mPFC and right rlPFC was negatively modulated by p(blame|w) (cluster-level whole brain FWE-corrected   P   = 0.039, CDT   P   = 0.05, Figure  A and  ) and the degree of negative modulation was significantly correlated with   (Spearman’s   = —0.34,   P   = 0.029). To clarify the specific neural dynamics and to identify how those dynamics account for the control of UDN under blame expectation, we performed DCM analysis between two regions. In the RFX-BMS among 16 DCM models considering all possible interaction patterns between 2 regions, model 7 (Figure  B), which includes a driving input to the right mPFC by p(blame|w), a bidirectional fixed connection between two regions and modulation of both connections by p(blame|w), was selected with a PEP of 0.999. We conducted a robust linear regression analysis using the parameter   as a dependent variable and two effective connectivities, one from the right mPFC to the right rlPFC and another from the right rlPFC to the right mPFC in model 7, as independent variables to identify which direction of modulation by p(blame|w) was related to the suppression of UDN. Only the effective connectivity from the right rlPFC to the right mPFC negatively influenced   (  = −0.46,   t  [29] =  −3.09,   P   = 0.004, CIs: −0.75 to −0.17,   d   = −0.5), whereas the effective connectivity in the opposite direction did not (  = −0.2,   t  [29] =  −1.33,   P   = 0.193, CIs: −0.49 to 0.09,   d   = −0.2). Furthermore, because the modulation from the baseline ‘fixed’ connectivity was related to the modulation of UDN by p(blame|w), we suspected that the fixed connection from the right rlPFC to the right mPFC might be related to the UDN and the modulation of this connection is related to the control of UDN. To test this hypothesis, we performed a robust linear regression analysis using the parameter ζ, which is related to the UDN as the dependent variable and the fixed connection from the right rlPFC to the right mPFC as an independent variable, which showed a positive relationship between two variables (beta = 0.24,   t  [30] = 2.08,   P   = 0.047, CIs: 0.01 to 0.46,   d   = 0.4, Figure  B). In summary, we showed that the UDN is related to the fixed connection from the right rlPFC to the right mPFC and that the modulation of this connection via p(blame|w) is related to UDN suppression. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUnder the condition that a wrong decision leads to severe blame by another, we must regulate ourselves to make better decisions. In such situation, participants enhanced their ability to make better choices under uncertainty through the suppression of UDN. This means that when one is already confident about the best action, then an expectation of being blamed has little effect—however, when one is unsure, then blame tends to increase optimal choices by reducing random exploration. However, expecting such blame with high probability impaired participants’ mood. Furthermore, fMRI analyses, including DCM analyses, revealed that a neural mechanism underlying this behavioural tendency is related to the suppression of connectivity from the right rlPFC to the mPFC as p(blame|w) increases, where the right rlPFC was engaged in processing the sub-optimal option and the right mPFC was activated by p(blame|w). \n\nOur study improves our understanding of the behavioural and neural mechanisms of optimal decision-making strategies to avoid aversive outcomes expected for incorrect decisions in a social context and how such kind of stressor influences our mood. From a behavioural perspective, when punishment or loss is expected with lower performance, participants enhance their performance by enhancing working memory function ( ) or inhibitory control mechanisms ( ). However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have proposed the computational mechanisms that are involved in optimizing uncertain decisions under punishment expectations based on explicit computational models of behaviour. In the present study, using the CUDN model, we successfully showed that participants increased good and accurate choices when a conditional probability of blame given a wrong choice was high through the flexible control of UDN. \n\nIn many cases, random exploration might be beneficial for maximizing a long-term expected reward because it helps the individual obtain information about uncertain options ( ;  ). However, in situations such as our task, where there is no more information gain by choosing one option over another, random exploration would become a choice that might decrease the accuracy of the choice. We modelled this effect of expectation of being blamed on uncertainty-driven sub-optimal choices using a CUDN model in which an uncertainty increases decision noise and p(blame|w) controls this UDN; this model explained participants’ behaviours better than other models. An interesting point regarding models where p(blame|w) had a negative value is that p(blame|w) naturally decreased the decision noise, regardless of the amount of uncertainty, which is different from the CUDN model in which only UDN is influenced by p(blame|w). Therefore, another point recognized from the Bayesian model selection results is that p(blame|w) likely controls the decision noise in a manner proportional to a degree of uncertainty but not in an uncertainty-independent manner. Because the decision noise increases with uncertainty, the requirement for the suppression of UDN to make an optimal choice is higher when high uncertainty exists. Furthermore, based on the results of the post-experimental survey, we recognized that participants made more deliberate, effort-driven decisions under threat, resulting in the suppression of (uncertainty-driven) decision noise. Thus, we surmise that the suppression of decision noise might require a mental effort that is costly to exert ( ;  ). Therefore, we speculated that a balance between the cost of deliberation and the need to suppress decision noise to make an optimal choice under uncertainty might increase the efficiency of the suppression of UDN, particularly in a volatile environment in which an uncertainty level continuously changes, such as in our task. \n\nAfter confirming that p(blame|w) controlled the UDN, we revealed that the suppression of UDN enabled the participant to make a better choice by showing a positive correlation between increased good choice proportion and accuracy in the high-blame blocks and the model parameter  . Therefore, our behavioural results suggest that when a wrong choice is likely to result in an aversive outcome under the uncertain decision-making situation used in our task, an agent tries to make a better choice by suppressing UDN to some degree. However, although ν well explained individual differences regarding the effect of p(blame|w) on controlling UDN, it seems that this parameter alone is insufficient to explain this effect. Considering that group average of ν was not significantly different from the 0 despite increased good/accurate choice in high-blame blocks, we speculate that this effect could be implemented by a whole CUDN model including interactions between ν other parameters. For example, because an increase of optimal choice depends on decreasing UDN, an effect of p(blame|w) on controlling UDN would be affected also by the ζ. Note that ζ determines the degree of decision noise induced by an uncertainty. This point is a limitation of our study and should be investigated in future studies. Additionally, we also have shown that an inference regarding a conditional probability of the blame significantly impaired participants’ mood. People suffer from abusive supervision are at high risk of affective disorder ( ). We speculate that people who are frequently exposed to abusive supervision similar to our task such that their supervisor forces them to make good decision under uncertainty with social punishment would be more likely to evolve an affective disorder by an accumulation of a daily negative mood induced by an aversive outcome expectation by their wrong decision. \n\nWe then identified the neural mechanism underlying the expectation of blame and the suppression of the UDN by p(blame|w). The regions involved in processing p(blame|w) included the mPFC, hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which are similar to the regions involved in the ‘cognitive fear circuitry’ ( ). The suggested role for this circuit was strategic avoidance of a threat ( ), and the authors mentioned that the mPFC is likely involved in selecting defensive response strategies ( ). This region contains ‘strategy-selective’ cells that protect against threats, as reported in an animal study ( ). Moreover, the mPFC is related to internally driven strategy shifts ( ). Consistent with these studies, subsequent DCM analyses revealed the involvement of the mPFC in the control of UDN. Especially, neural dynamics involving the right mPFC and rlPFC were related to the control of UDN via p(blame|w). Two regions had bilateral fixed connections, and these connections were negatively modulated according to the p(blame|w). Importantly, among these two directional connections, only the connection from the right rlPFC to the right mPFC was relevant to the control of UDN, such that the UDN itself was related to the fixed connection from the right rlPFC to the right mPFC, and the control of the UDN was related to the modulation of this connection via p(blame|w). \n\nBased on these results, we propose a possible neural ‘gate’ model regarding the control of the UDN based on p(blame|w) that fits with the structure of the CUDN model. In the CUDN model, given a fixed value of the sub-optimal option, (i) uncertainty increased the probability of choosing the sub-optimal option and (ii) p(blame|w) decreased such effect of uncertainty (represented by the decision noise modulation in the model). Similarly, in the DCM analyses, (i) influence of uncertainty on decision temperature (UDN) was related to the strength of fixed connectivity from rlPFC to mPFC and (ii) p(blame|w) decreased the connectivity from rlPFC to mPFC, which was related to a p(blame|w)’s effect on decreasing UDN. (iii) p(blame|w) increased the mPFC activity. From these information, we focused on how p(blame|w) information can modulate the connectivity from rlPFC to mPFC while activating the right mPFC. We suggest that (i) the UDN information is encoded in the fixed connection from the right rlPFC to the mPFC. (ii) If p(blame|w) increases, p(blame|w) information is conveyed to the right mPFC and activates this region. (iii) Using this p(blame|w) information, the mPFC regulates the flow from the right rlPFC to the mPFC to control the UDN. This gate model could explain the concurrent activation of the mPFC and the negative modulation of the connection from the right rlPFC and the mPFC based on p(blame|w). This gate model not only corroborates our behavioural and fMRI analyses but also is consistent with previous studies suggesting that the mPFC controls strategic avoidance behaviour under threat ( ). Furthermore, a previous study suggested that the mPFC controls the slower and deliberate decision-making associated with difficult choices by modifying the decision threshold of the drift-diffusion model via an interaction with the sub-thalamic nucleus ( ). Especially, increasing of decision threshold increases the RT and reduces the choice noise ( ), which is effect similar to that of an effect of p(blame|w). Therefore, it could be possible that a ‘gate’ in the mPFC controlled by p(blame|w) might correspond to an increase of decision threshold. \n\nOne notable point is that whether our result could be generalizable to non-social punishment such as physical pain. Because we did not perform a similar experiment using a non-social punishment (e.g. physical pain or monetary loss), it is difficult to determine whether this effect is universal to all types of punishment or specific to blame. However, the results of this study allow us to infer the similarity and dissimilarity of the blame with other non-social stimuli. For example, if the expectation of blame is similar to that of loss, we would expect that the p(blame|w) would contribute as a negative value; however, this result was not the case in the behavioural modelling section. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that physical and social pain are similar in both emotional response and saliency as well as share a similar neural representation ( ). Moreover, we observed a similar between updating blame expectation and updating of physical pain expectation, which we discussed in the above section ( ). Therefore, we hypothesize that the effect of expecting blame might be more similar to that of expecting physical pain than to that of expecting a monetary loss. However, this hypothesis is only speculative, and an experiment using non-social stimuli might help us to identify both the similar and different neural and behaviour mechanisms that underlie the optimization of behaviour under social and non-social threats. Finally, one should note that one limitation of our computational modelling was that the result was susceptible to the selection of prior parameters, which could be resulted from the complexity of the CUDN model. \n\nIn conclusion, we identified one strategy for optimizing uncertain decision-making under a threat and the underlying neural mechanism. Because there was no benefit of the sub-optimal choice in our task, the suppression of UDN under the blame expectation helped participants to make better decisions in those situations, and this phenomenon was successfully modelled using the CUDN model. On the other hand, an expectation of being blamed deteriorated participants’ mood. The implementation of this behavioural optimization strategy was related to the suppression of effective connectivity from the right rlPFC to the right mPFC as p(blame|w) increased. These results added one novel neural mechanism of a brain region related to processing threat that actually interacted with other decision-making-related regions to avoid a threatening outcome. \n\nBecause we addressed only one optimization mechanism under particular conditions, where directed exploration is absent or minimal, an extension of our research to determine how directed exploration is influenced in this situation would be interesting. Based on recent findings that people became more ‘myopic’ under the threat ( ), we speculate that directed exploration would also be reduced by blame expectation and it could explain reduced creativity under the threat. Finally, from the perspective of computational psychiatry, an investigation of the optimization behaviour of our task in patients with psychiatric conditions, such as autism and psychopathologies, would be interesting to quantify their lack of an ability to expect social responses and utilize adaptive behaviours ( ). \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"625931e2512c5afb2d0892b71d70c117"}

Phasic dopamine release depends on immediate reward magnitude, but presumably also on tonic dopamine levels, which may vary as a function of the average accumulation of reward over time. Using model-based fMRI in combination with a novel associative memory task, we show that immediate reward magnitude exerts a monotonically increasing influence on the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and hippocampal activity during encoding, and enhances memory. By contrast, average reward levels modulate feedback-related responses in the VTA and hippocampus in a non-linear (inverted U-shape) fashion, with similar effects on memory performance. Additionally, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) monotonically tracks average reward levels, while VTA-dACC functional connectivity is non-linearly modulated (inverted U-shape) by average reward. We propose that the dACC computes the net behavioral impact of average reward and relays this information to memory circuitry via the VTA. \n  \nRewarded stimuli are better encoded in memory. Here, the authors show that the average accumulation of reward over consecutive trials provides an additive, non-linear (inverted U-shape) modulation of memory encoding, paralleled by a similar recruitment of dopaminergic memory circuitry. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe ability to remember details associated with reward provides an adaptive advantage because it facilitates access to, for example, food and water. Indeed, reward-related information has priority in memory, as evidenced by studies reporting better memory for information presented in trials where a large reward was presented or anticipated (as compared with smaller or no reward) . Rewarding events, such as reward feedbacks or cues predictive of reward, initiate phasic dopamine release from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) , a midbrain region with dopaminergic projections to the hippocampus (HC) whose involvement in episodic memory encoding is well established . Thus, the prioritization of reward-related information is presumably mediated by dopaminergic influences on hippocampal plasticity . \n\nRecent research suggests enhanced memory encoding beyond the rewarded event itself. For example, Mather and Shoeke  reported that positive (as compared with negative) feedback enhanced recognition memory for information presented in the immediate trial, as well as in the two subsequent trials. Likewise, we recently demonstrated better memory for associations encoded in trials preceded by many (versus few) rewarded trials . Such modulation of memory for information surrounding contexts associated with frequent rewards likely offers a unique evolutionary advantage. For example, better memory for cues encountered in the vicinity of a location with high food availability increases the probability of successfully finding ones’ way to this location in the future. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying these sustained effects of reward on memory formation remain poorly understood. On the one hand, it has been proposed that average reward is encoded by tonic dopamine levels , which may result from a sustained mode of dopamine neuron activity that is capable of up- or downregulating phasic dopamine release , and would thereby modulate memory encoding. Related to this notion, one elegant study reported that the anticipation of uncertain rewards, a condition which is known to induce a sustained “ramping response” of dopamine neurons , increased incidental memory encoding for images presented during the reward anticipation period . On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that the VTA is under top-down control from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) . The dorsal ACC (dACC) supposedly integrates external and internal motivational factors, such as those related to rewards . Moreover, the dACC can modulate reward-related dopamine release by directly interacting with the VTA . Thus, the dACC could contribute to memory encoding by regulating VTA function based on current average reward levels. It is also important to note that the relationship between reward levels and memory might not be linear. In particular, increased levels of dopamine enhance memory encoding only up to a certain point, after which additional dopamine may become detrimental for memory encoding . Yet, it is currently unclear whether these effects of dopamine on memory formation relate to changes in VTA function and/or in other brain regions involved in memory formation and motivation, such as the HC and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). \n\nTo elucidate the neural underpinnings of average reward effects on memory encoding, here we combine model-based fMRI with a recently developed associative memory paradigm that allows control of immediate reward magnitude and average reward levels on a trial-wise basis during encoding . To test whether high levels of average reward impair (rather than promote) learning, we include trials that yield higher relative reward as compared with our previous study, in which we found a linear relationship between average reward and memory encoding . We predict that immediate reward magnitude and average reward levels during encoding engage brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation (i.e., the VTA and its downstream target the NAcc) and memory formation (i.e., the HC and the parahippocampal gyrus; PHG), and account for variance in subsequently tested memory performance. However, because the brain loci enabling a non-linear effect of dopamine on episodic memory formation are unclear, we make no specific predictions regarding a differential neuronal representation of linear versus nonlinear effects of immediate and average reward. \n\nIn brief, we show that immediate reward-feedback magnitude has a monotonically increasing influence on NAcc, VTA, and hippocampal activity during encoding, and enhances memory retention. Critically, average reward levels during encoding exert a nonlinear modulation (i.e., an inverted U-shape) on: (1) activity in the VTA, the HC, and the PHG, (2) functional connectivity between the dACC and the VTA, and (3) subsequently tested memory performance. By contrast, dACC activity negatively correlates with average reward levels. While the present study confirms a sustained influence of reward feedback on memory encoding, via its modulation of average reward levels and phasic responsivity of dopamine circuitry, these results also support the notion that dACC–VTA interactions regulate motivated behavior. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Brief task description \n  \nDuring fMRI scanning, 34 participants performed an associative memory task consisting of one memory encoding session followed by a memory test session. In each trial of the encoding session, participants were presented with the face of a cartoon character and one pair of objects (Fig.  ), and guessed which of the two objects the character preferred. Subsequent feedback indicated how much the character liked the selected object: very much (+5 feedback), moderately (+1 feedback), or disliked (−1 feedback; Fig.  ). Participants were instructed to learn the preferences that six different characters had for ten different object pairs, because the memory for the preferences would later be tested. Unbeknownst to participants, the feedbacks were predetermined, such that two characters each received on average high, medium, or low levels of reward (as determined by the ratio between the number of +5 and +1 feedbacks, see Fig.  ). In order to fully control the average level of reward, each character–object pair was shown only once and all ten preferences for one character was encoded before the ten preferences for the next character was encoded, and so forth (i.e., 60 encoding trials in total). The memory test session was largely similar to the encoding session, but no feedback was provided and the order of character–object pairs was pseudorandomized. Points corresponded to a monetary bonus provided at the end of the experiment (see “Methods” for further details).    Stimuli and behavioral results.  \n a   During both encoding and testing, each trial started with the presentation of a cartoon character together with two objects. During encoding trials, participants randomly selected one object and then received a feedback indicating how much the selected object was liked by the character (see   b  ).   c   During encoding, three different feedback values were presented indicating whether a selected object was disliked (magenta circle, −1), moderately liked (blue circle, +1), or very much liked (green circle, +5).   d   Average reward was the average of ten feedback values displayed for a given character. Two characters were associated with high (Hi) average reward (one +1, five +5s), two with medium (Me) average reward (three +1s, three +5s), and two with low (Lo) average reward (five +1s and one +5).   e   Memory performance (proportion correct) increased monotonically as a function of feedback value.   f  .

The images used to illustrate the paradigm in   a  ,   b   were obtained from   and  . \n  \n\n\n### Memory performance \n  \nMemory performance was assessed in the test session, administered 20 min following the end of the encoding session, during which participants had to recall and select the preferred object in each of the ten object pairs for each of the six characters. Performance was calculated as the proportion of correct selections of character–object associations encoded during positive (+1, +5) feedback and correct rejections of associations encoded during negative (−1) feedback. Memory performance was analyzed for the different types of reward presented during the encoding, i.e., three levels of Feedback value (−1, +1, +5) and three levels of Average reward (Lo, Me, Hi). A linear mixed effects model with fixed effects Feedback value (−1, +1, +5) and Average reward (Lo, Me, Hi) and participant as random effect revealed a significant main effect of Feedback value [Fig.  ;   F  (2, 288) = 17.905,   p   < 0.001, ANOVA] because memory was better for character–object associations encoded during +5 feedback [mean ± SEM: 0.739 ± 0.028] as compared with +1 feedback [mean ± SEM: 0.671 ± 0.019,   t  (32) = 2.545,   p   = 0.016,   d   = 0.490, 95% CI = 0.014–0.122, paired   t  -test] and −1 feedback [mean ± SEM: 0.552 ± 0.025,   t  (32) = 5.728,   p   < 0.001,   d   = 1.214, 95% CI = 0.120–0.253, paired   t  -test]. Associations encoded during +1 feedback were also better remembered as compared with −1 feedback [  t  (32) = 4.039,   p   < 0.001,   d   = 0.929, 95% CI = 0.059–0.179, paired   t  -test]. When tested separately, memory performance was above change (memory performance > 0.5) for all three types of feedback value [all three   p   values < 0.05, one-sample   t-  test]. \n\nThe main effect of Average reward was also significant [Fig.  ;   F  (2,288) = 4.792,   p   = 0.009 ANOVA], with the highest memory performance for associations encoded during Me average reward [mean ± SEM: 0.688 ± 0.023], both as compared with Lo average reward [mean ± SEM: 0.623 ± 0.025,   t  (32) = 2.240,   p   = 0.032,   d   = 0.470, 95% CI = 0.006–0.123, paired   t  -test], and Hi average reward [mean ± SEM: 0.620 ± 0.021,   t  (32) = 3.230,   p   = 0.003,   d   = 0.544, 95% CI = 0.025–0.111, paired   t  -test]. There was no difference in memory performance between Lo and Hi average reward [  t  (32) = −0.138,   p   = 0.891,   d   = 0.027, 95% CI = −0.049–0.056, paired   t  -test]. The interaction between Feedback value and Average reward was not significant [  F  (4,288) = 1.008,   p   = 0.404, ANOVA], suggesting independent contributions of Feedback value and Average reward to memory formation. The main effects of Feedback value and Average reward remained significant when controlling for presentation order during encoding, presentation order during testing, and cartoon character identity (see Supplementary Note  ). \n\n\n### Computational modeling \n  \nComputational modeling was used to provide a more fine-grained (i.e., trial-wise) description of the relationship between the different types of reward and memory formation. The fits of different computational models to behavior are displayed in Table   (for full details of these models, see “Methods”). The best fit to behavior was provided by the   model, which assumes linear and quadratic influences from feedback value and average reward on memory formation, respectively [the average Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) of this model was significantly smaller as compared with the average AIC of each of the other models, all   p   values < 0.05, paired   t  -tests]. The   model also provided the most parsimonious fit as compared with models fitting initial average reward levels and learning rates for each character separately (see Supplementary Note  ).   \nModel fits. \n  \n C   ,C  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,v  , and   w   are parameters fitted to each individual’s behavior. \n\n LLE  , negative log-likelihood estimate,   AIC  , Akaike’s information criterion. \n\nThe model providing the most parsimonious fit to behavior, as indicated by significantly lower AIC values. Mean ± SEM. \n  \n\nFigure   illustrates how average reward levels   change as a function of recently received feedback. As expected, the highest and the smallest accumulated level of average reward were obtained in the Hi and Lo average reward categories, respectively (Fig.  ). Figure   illustrates the contribution of average reward levels to the encoding probability (  p  ).   p   increased with increasing levels of average reward, until the “optimal” level of average reward (  w  ), at which point additional levels of average reward reduced the encoding probability (Fig.  ).    Computational model.  \n a  –  d   illustrates how parameter values in the computational model derive from the behavioral data, here for one representative participant.   a   The average reward level ( , black line) tracks preceding feedback values as an exponential running average.

By contrast,   p   decreases whenever   becomes larger or smaller than   w  . To further illustrate the nonlinear contribution of   to   p  , the quadratic term   is displayed as a red line. White, gray, and black bars respectively illustrate the average   p   of the ten trials within each average reward category.   d   The average   p   across the average reward categories in (  c  ).   e   Across participants, the most parsimonious model indicates that the encoding probability   p   increases monotonically as a function of feedback value, but is nonlinearly modulated by average reward (  f  ).   g   On average the model predicts higher encoding probabilities for subsequent hits as compared with misses. ***  p   < 0.001, ns not significant (i.e.,   p   > 0.05), indicates the   p   value for paired   t  -test. The horizontal lines in   e  ,   f  , and   g   indicate mean ± SEM. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\nThe fit of the   model to behavioral data is displayed in Fig.  , and shows the same significant effects as actual behavior (Fig.  ; see Supplementary Note  ). Of note, the level of average reward was not constrained to particular character identities, as the   model provided a better fit as compared with other models fitting (1) one baseline value of average reward which was reset whenever a new character was presented during encoding (see the   with   model), or (2) six different baseline levels of average reward (i.e., one for each character; see Supplementary Note  ). Moreover, as would be expected, the   model predicted a higher encoding probability for trials subsequently classified as hits [mean ± SEM: 0.679 ± 0.018], as compared with misses [mean ± SEM: 0.574 ± 0.015,   t  (32) = 9.620,   p   < 0.001,   d   = 1.136, 95% CI = 0.083–0.128, paired   t  -test]. Thus, the computational modeling approach also confirmed the hypothesized link between average reward and memory formation. \n\n\n### fMRI \n  \nTo determine the neuronal correlates of the different reward types during memory encoding, we combined fMRI data with trial-by-trial estimates of feedback values and average reward levels obtained from the   model. Because feedback values and average reward levels respectively impacted subsequent memory performance in a monotonically increasing and in a nonlinear fashion, we predicted that blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in reward- and memory-related brain regions should be similarly modulated by feedback value (i.e., monotonically increasing) and average reward (i.e., in an inverted U-shape fashion). \n\n\n### Positive correlations between BOLD and feedback values \n  \nAn increase in feedback value was reflected in increasing BOLD signal in the bilateral NAcc and in bilateral clusters extending into both the HC, the PHG, and the amygdala (Fig.   and Table  ). However, given the well-known role of the VTA in reward processing and reward-related memory enhancements, it was surprising that no voxels with the VTA ROI tracked feedback value. To test whether this null-result may have been related to the selection of an anatomically defined VTA ROI, in combination with a strict requirement for the number of overlapping voxels across participants (50%; see “Methods”), we performed an additional analysis using a conservative ROI approach in a functionally defined VTA ROI. This VTA ROI was based on coordinates obtained from a previous study looking at reward-related memory enhancements , and we previously used this VTA ROI to test prediction error encoding in the dopaminergic midbrain . This supplementary analysis revealed that BOLD signal in this VTA ROI indeed correlated with feedback values (see Supplementary Note  ).    Linear BOLD signal increases as a function of feedback value.  \nBOLD signal in the bilateral NAcc ROI (  a  –  c  ), and the HC/PHG ROIs (  d  –  i  ) increased monotonically with feedback value.

However, a complimentary ROI analysis using a slightly different and functionally defined VTA ROI showed that VTA BOLD signal significantly tracked feedback value (see Supplementary Note 4 for details). \n\nThe amygdala was not part of the initial hypotheses, thus a stricter (Bonferroni-corrected) statistical threshold was applied in order to infer any involvement of the amygdala (  α   = 0.0167). \n  \n\nBecause feedback values modulated memory performance (Figs.  f and  ), these results are in accordance with previous studies showing that reward-related effects on memory encoding are associated with increased activity in the NAcc, the VTA, the HC, and the PHG . Sagittal views of these activations are provided in the Supplementary Note  . \n\n\n### Non linear modulation of BOLD by average reward levels \n  \nBOLD signal was modulated in an inverted U-shape fashion by average reward in the VTA, the amygdala, and in bilateral HC/PHG clusters (Fig.   and Table  ). Because average reward levels contributed significantly to memory encoding (inverted U-shape; Figs.  g and  ), this result suggests that average reward influences memory encoding by engaging dopaminergic memory circuitry. Sagittal views of these activations are provided in the Supplementary Note  . Additional supplementary analyses, using a more conservative ROI approach, confirmed the robustness of the effect of average reward on VTA activity across different VTA ROIs and smoothing kernels (see Supplementary Note  ). Of note, a separate fMRI analysis confirmed that average reward had no impact on BOLD signal during stimulus presentation (see Supplementary Note  ). Moreover, the conjunction between the BOLD signal modulated by average reward (inverted U-shape) and feedback value revealed that no voxels in the a priori ROIs were significantly modulated by both feedback value and average reward (the conjunction was tested versus the “conjunction null hypothesis”  with an initial search threshold of   p   = 0.001).

It has recently been proposed that the dACC both keeps track of environmental states, such as current availability of reward or effort needed to obtain a goal, and regulates neuromodulatory systems (including dopaminergic reward signals in the VTA) in order to respond appropriately to changes in the environment . In the context of the present study, we predicted that the dACC would encode average reward levels (i.e., environmental tracking) and communicate the behavioral impact of average reward to the VTA (i.e., neuromodulatory regulation). Specifically, we investigated these hypotheses by testing for linear correlations between average reward and dACC BOLD signal and nonlinear modulations of VTA–dACC functional connectivity by average reward. \n\nUsing a generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) approach (seed ROI defined as the voxels within the VTA ROI that correlated non linearly with average reward; Fig.  ), we confirmed that the functional connectivity between the VTA and the dACC was modulated in a nonlinear fashion by average reward (inverted U-shape; Fig.  ; peak MNI   x   y   z   = 3 35 13; T(32) = 3.751; pSVC = 0.037). Moreover, dACC BOLD signal significantly and linearly correlated with average reward levels (Fig.  ; peak MNI   x   y   z   = 0 32 22; T(32) = 4.155; pSVC = 0.016).

T-statistics were obtained from   t  -tests. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe investigated the influence of reward feedback and average accumulated reward on associative memory formation. Three different levels of feedback value (−1, +1, +5) and average reward (Lo, Me, Hi) during encoding were tested. Model-based fMRI was used to assess how memory performance related to trial-by-trial changes in neural activity under these reward regimes during encoding. \n\nMemory performance increased monotonically for character–object associations encoded during −1, +1, and +5 feedbacks, respectively. This effect was mirrored by activity in the NAcc, the VTA, the HC, and the PHG at encoding. These memory effects primarily depended on the feedback value at encoding (and not the expected reward at memory recall) because associations encoded during +1 feedback were better remembered than those encoded during −1 feedback, although correctly remembering both types of trials in the memory test would yield +1 point. One plausible explanation for these results can be derived from studies showing that unexpected positive or negative feedbacks elicit phasic increases (bursts) or decreases (dips) in dopamine neuron activity, respectively . Dopamine neurons project to the NAcc, which is anatomically and functionally linked to the HC . Accordingly, differences in phasic dopamine neuron activity during encoding may explain why associations are better remembered following +1 feedback, as compared with −1 feedback (and similarly why +5 feedbacks caused even better memory performance) . The monotonically increasing relationship between three levels of feedback value and memory formation extends previous research showing better memory for information encoded during the presentation or expectation of binary (i.e., large versus small) rewards, with neural correlates overlapping those obtained in the present study . \n\nMoreover, our results support previous studies reporting better memory for information presented in association with feedback, such as positive versus negative feedback , larger feedback prediction errors , or the unsigned feedback prediction error . However, some other studies report that memory was not modulated by feedback magnitude  or feedback prediction error , or was negatively influenced by the feedback prediction error . Unfortunately, these studies, although being just a handful, present a large variety in experimental parameters which may have contributed to these seemingly discrepant results. To name a few: encoding type (incidental versus intentional), memory type (associative versus recognition memory), encoding-testing delay period (short versus long), sleep during the delay period (with versus without sleep), task relevance of memoranda, timing of stimuli, and reinforcement learning paradigm (Pavlovian versus instrumental). While the potential influence of these factors on reward-related memory have been discussed elsewhere , we note that many of the studies reporting a positive impact of feedback value on memory formation (including ours), presented the information to be remembered (i.e., the memoranda) in close temporal vicinity to the feedback , while those reporting no or a negative impact of feedback value presented the memoranda prior to the feedback . For example, Jang et al.  presented rewards either before memoranda (to induce reward anticipation), during memoranda (to elicit what the authors termed an “image prediction error”), or after memoranda (to elicit a feedback prediction error). Strikingly, while neither the feedback prediction error nor the reward anticipation impacted on subsequent memory performance, the image prediction error, elicited by the presentation of memoranda, correlated positively with subsequent memory performance . Thus, reward delivery might influence memory encoding in a limited time window, perhaps constrained by the rapid phasic response of dopamine neurons to reward delivery (<500 ms; ). Yet, because a few other studies showed that activating the reward system before and after memoranda also increased subsequent memory performance , further research needs to determine to what extent memory formation depends on the relative timing between memoranda and different aspects of reward, and how these relate to the different response profiles of the dopamine system, i.e., phasic bursts and dips, tonic activity, and sustained ramping responses . \n\nDuring memory encoding, activity in the VTA and brain regions implicated in memory formation (i.e., HC and PHG) was modulated by average reward in a nonlinear fashion (i.e., inverted U-shape). Memory performance (as tested in a subsequent memory test) showed the same (inverted U-shape) modulation by average reward, whereby intermediate levels of average reward yielded best memory retention. The finding that average reward modulates feedback-related neural activity in the VTA and the HC during encoding, with similar impact on subsequently tested memory performance, supports theories postulating that reward enhances memory formation via dopaminergic influences on HC plasticity . Yet, reward feedback induces rapid phasic bursting activity of dopamine neurons , while average reward is presumably encoded by slower changes in tonic dopamine levels . These seemingly discrepant findings can be reconciled by animal research showing that the overall phasic dopamine response scales with the number of “active” dopamine neurons, while the number of active dopamine neurons is reflected in tonic dopamine levels . \n\nNotably, this interpretation suggests that the HC loci for the effects of feedback value and immediate reward on memory encoding should overlap, yet a conjunction analysis revealed no significant voxel overlap between the different contrasts. Seen through the lenses of phasic and tonic dopamine, such a result has been predicted by previous literature based on notions that different types of dopamine receptors show different degrees of affinity and are heterogeneously distributed throughout the HC. For example, Shohamy and Adcock  theorized that tonic dopamine acts on D5 receptors, which are mainly extrasynaptic, while phasic dopamine is restricted to engage other types of dopamine receptors located within a synapse. Moreover, Edelmann and Lessman  suggested that tonic dopamine firing only activates high-affinity D2 receptors, while phasic dopamine firing additionally and briefly activates low-affinity D1 and D5 receptors. In addition, Rosen et al.  showed that the flow of information between regions of the HC may be controlled by the dopaminergic midbrain. Specifically, optogenetic stimulation of the VTA that simulated tonic/phasic mode of dopamine release caused inhibition/facilitation of postsynaptic potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons following Schaffer collateral stimulation, thus suggesting that information flow within the HC is determined by the current mode of dopamine activity. Because this effect was specifically dependent on D4 receptors, the impact of tonic/phasic dopamine activity might be most pronounced in regions of the HC with a higher density of D4 receptors. In summary, phasic and tonic dopamine activity may engage different regions of the HC by acting upon different dopamine receptors spread heterogeneously across the HC. \n\nBeyond average reward, a sustained “ramping” dopaminergic response, consistent with tonic dopamine activity, can be triggered by the anticipation of uncertain rewards . One study showed that memory for images presented during periods of uncertain reward anticipation was enhanced when tested after both short and long delays . Another study reported better memory, as tested after a short delay only, for items encoded during high-risk (versus low-risk) contexts, where risk was determined by the variance of the reward magnitude . While the authors speculated that differences in arousal mediated the effect of risk on memory encoding, it is tempting to propose that tonic dopamine activity, induced by uncertain reward anticipation (caused by a large variance in reward magnitude), may also have contributed to this effect. Future neuroimaging studies need to elucidate whether the effects of average reward, uncertain reward anticipation, and risk on memory encoding are related to similar engagement of the VTA. \n\nRegarding the nonlinearity of the modulation by average reward in the present study, it was previously shown in humans that slightly increased levels of dopamine (achieved via L-DOPA administration) enhanced memory formation, while excessive dopamine levels had a detrimental impact (i.e., inverted U-shape , see also ). By increasing the overall level of average reward, as compared with our previous study , we show that elevated levels of average reward also impede memory formation. What could explain this nonlinear influence of average reward (and dopamine) on memory formation? Dopamine is important for optimizing energy expenditure , and tonic dopamine may signal opportunity costs , the value of work , or effort . Accordingly, low average reward (e.g., food scarcity during winter) promotes sloth because the value of work is low, while increasing levels of average reward (e.g., food availability during spring) promotes action by signaling an increased value of work. However, when rewards are bountiful (e.g., a domestic animal’s constant access to food), the value of work is constant and hard work is unnecessary. It therefore seems unreasonable that average reward has a monotonously increasing impact on behavior. Instead, as detailed next, we propose that the behavioral impact of average reward is first determined by the dACC, a brain region involved in the integration of different motivational factors, and then actuated via dACC–VTA interactions. \n\nThe dACC integrates different types of motivational information, such as reward, effort, and punishment , and determines behavior via top-down influences on the VTA . The VTA is well known for its role in enabling motivated behavior . A recent elaborate model suggests that dACC function can be described by two integrated modules . One module monitors environmental states, such as the effort, risk, or reward associated with obtaining a goal, and selects appropriate actions, while the other module regulates the release of neuromodulators, including reward-related dopamine release from the VTA. In line with this model, we show a monotonic relationship between average reward levels and dACC BOLD (in accordance with a dACC monitoring function), and a nonlinear modulation by average reward on VTA–dACC functional connectivity (which is compatible with a dACC neuromodulatory regulation function). VTA–dACC functional connectivity was highest for the intermediate level of average reward during encoding, as was activity in the VTA and subsequently tested memory performance. Of note, dACC activity is increased by factors that reduce the expected value of future rewards, including effort needed to obtain the rewards, uncertainty associated with the reward outcome, error likelihood, and perceived decision difficulty (for reviews, see refs.  ). Thus, because average reward levels estimate the current likelihood of receiving a large reward, dACC activity should be negatively correlated with average reward levels, a prediction corroborated by the present results. Given our results in combination with previous research, we propose that the dACC encodes average reward, determines its behavioral impact (after considering other concurrent factors), and then transmits this information to memory circuitry via the VTA. \n\nThe neuronal mechanisms in the VTA that are impacted by a dACC–VTA modulation are largely unknown, yet the ACC projects directly to VTA dopamine neurons via glutamatergic projections , and glutamatergic afferents to dopamine neurons supposedly control transitions between phasic and tonic activity . Moreover, shifting the balance between excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic inputs to the VTA increased the spontaneous activation of dopamine neurons , and glutamate iontophoresis increased both the baseline firing rate and the burst firing frequency of dopamine neurons . Thus, one plausible mechanism, which certainly needs empirical confirmation, is that top-down control of the VTA from the dACC occurs via glutamatergic inputs to the VTA that alter tonic dopamine activity by changing the number of spontaneously “active” dopamine neurons (i.e., neurons that may elicit phasic burst firing), and thus also the overall phasic dopamine response . \n\nAlthough not part of our initial hypotheses, post-hoc tests indicated that feedback-related activation clusters (both monotonically increasing by feedback value and nonlinearly modulated by average reward) extended into the bilateral amygdala. Previous studies looking at reward-related memory enhancements have not reported the involvement of the amygdala , which in some cases may be due to highly constrained ROI analyses . However, amygdala’s involvement in reward-related memory encoding is not surprising, given its role in emotion-related memory enhancement. For example, the amygdala was activated bilaterally when participants viewed pleasant and unpleasant images, and the degree of amygdala activation correlated with subsequently tested memory for these images . Moreover, the amygdala modulates the formation of hippocampal-dependent episodic memories , possibly via its ability to encode different aspects of emotionality, such as valence and salience . Because the amygdala is interconnected with both the HC and the VTA , amygdala modulation of memory encoding in the present study could be accomplished in (at least) two different ways. First, via direct influences on hippocampal plasticity , or by regulating VTA dopamine neurons that project to the HC, for example by transmitting motivational salience signals to the VTA . Future research should further clarify the role of the amygdala in reward-related memory enhancements. \n\nThe VTA encoded both feedback value and average reward while the NAcc only encoded feedback value. At first glance, the divergent encoding of average reward in the VTA and the NAcc is surprising given the extensive dopaminergic input from the VTA to the NAcc , in combination with results showing co-activation of the VTA and the NAcc in the context of prediction errors  and during rest . However, the NAcc receives input from many brain regions besides the VTA , and may therefore be influenced by information beyond that transmitted by VTA dopamine neurons . In line with this notion, one study alternated visual and auditory cues as being the relevant feature to predict upcoming rewards, and showed that the ventral striatum (of which the NAcc is part) tracked the value of the currently relevant stimulus only, and was activated by the correctness of the response rather than the outcome’s value . In a related study, participants learned the timing of reward outcomes rather than their magnitudes, and while the VTA tracked parameters related to both reward magnitudes and timings, the ventral striatum only tracked the reward timings, i.e., the task-relevant parameter. Similarly, participants in the present study learned the value of character–object associations, and this task-relevant feature was tracked by both the VTA and the NAcc. By contrast, the task-irrelevant average reward level was only tracked by the VTA. Thus, the ventral striatum/NAcc may update the features of the environment that are most relevant to drive behavior , a specific role that is not shared by the VTA. \n\nSome limitations of the present study needs to be acknowledged. First, we show that average reward modulates the encoding of character–object associations, yet it remains unknown to what extent average reward modulates the encoding of other types of information within a trial, such as memory for a particular character identity or objects. While the present study was not designed to test memory for individual stimuli, the experimental paradigm could easily be adapted to test such aspects by, for example, replacing the associative memory test with a stimulus recognition test. Another limitation, shared by many studies on human reward-related memory modulation, is that memory was tested after a relatively short delay period (i.e., 20 min after encoding in the present study). Thus, it remains unknown whether and how feedback value and average reward in the present study may modulate subsequent dopamine-dependent consolidation processes. Dopamine is believed to enable consolidation of long-term potentiation (LTP) , a cellular model of long-term memory . In brief, LTP posits that memories are initially encoded by changes in synaptic strengths following synaptic activation (early LTP), and that these changes, and thus also the memories they encode, quickly vanish unless the synapses undergo a stabilization/consolidation process that involves the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (late LTP) . While experimental evidence suggests that dopamine is important for both early and late LTP, it may be particularly relevant for late LTP. For example, administering dopamine antagonists before learning in a one-trial reward learning task impeded memory when tested after 24 h, but not when tested after 30 min . Accordingly, the impact of dopamine-releasing events during encoding, such as reward, may be particularly evident when memory is tested after long delays (i.e., after late LTP has occurred). Some human research support this notion by showing that reward-related enhancements of memory emerged only when tested after long delays (>24 h)  or after a nap  (which may allow for dopamine-related consolidation processes ). Yet, other studies report reward-related memory modulations when tested both after short (<30 min) and long delays , or when tested after short delays only . The latter results suggest that reward-related memory modulations do not always pertain to consolidation processes, but may also act directly on the encoding of a memory, a notion which is in line with the present results. Yet, future studies need to address the impact of average reward on later consolidation processes. A final limitation is that the current fMRI approach cannot address what low-level mechanism(s) could explain reward influences on memory encoding. Some experimental evidence suggests that dopamine lowers thresholds for LTP induction . Another interesting option relates to the notion of a three-factor rule of synaptic plasticity . In brief, this theory posits that co-activation of pre- and postsynaptic neurons sets an eligibility trace that allows synaptic change, but only in the presence of a third modulating factor. This modulatory factor may be dopamine, but could also be any other neuromodulator known to impact learning, such as acetylcholine, noreprinephrine, or serotonin. This rule explains rapid behavioral change without the need for consolidation, and is supported by recent experimental evidence obtained in the striatum, the prefrontal and visual cortices, and in the HC (see Gerstner et al.  for a recent review). Other mechanisms have also been suggested, i.e., see Box 5 of Lisman et al.  and Shohamy and Adcock . \n\nTo summarize, we show that reward feedback exhibits (1) an immediate and positive effect on memory encoding that engages the NAcc, the VTA, and hippocampal brain regions, and (2) a more sustained non-linear effect via its integration into average reward levels, which in turn modulates neural responses within the VTA–HC loop, as determined by the dACC and its interactions with the VTA. These results demonstrate that the accumulation of reward contributes to memory encoding success, with intermediate levels of average reward providing the most beneficial setting for memory encoding. The impact of average reward across cognitive domains, and its interaction with inter-individual differences related to dopamine functionality, remain to be investigated. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nFunctional MRI data were acquired while participants performed an associative memory task consisting of one memory encoding session and one memory test session. We designed different computational models explaining how immediate feedback value and average reward might differentially impact memory formation, and then fitted them to memory performance during the test session. The parameters derived from the most parsimonious model were then combined with fMRI data to uncover brain activity that correlated with the different dimensions of reward delivery during memory encoding. Specific details about the experimental procedures are presented below. \n\n### Participants \n  \nAfter having provided written and informed consent according to the ethical regulations of the Geneva University Hospital, 34 participants joined the experiment. All participants were right-handed, native French speakers, and without any previous history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data from one participant had to be excluded due to him/her falling asleep during the memory test phase. Thus, data from the remaining 33 participants were included in the subsequent analyses (15 females; average age ± SEM: 25.242 ± 0.874). \n\n\n### Associative memory task \n  \nEach participant performed an associative memory task consisting of one memory encoding session (9 min) and one memory test session (9 min). Both sessions were performed during fMRI scanning and were separated by 20 min. \n\nMemory encoding session: In each trial during the encoding session, a fixation cross was first presented for 3 s, followed by the face of a cartoon character presented together with a pair of objects  for 3.5 s (Fig.  ). Participants were instructed that the character moderately liked or very much liked one object in each pair, while disliking the other object. Participants had to indicate which object they thought that the character liked (moderately or very much) by pressing one of two buttons with the right hand. A feedback display, consisting of a number enclosed by a colored circle was then presented for 1 s (Fig.  ). The feedback indicated whether the character moderately liked (+1, blue circle), very much liked (+5, green circle), or disliked (−1, magenta circle) the selected object (Fig.  ). Besides informing about a preference, the feedback also indicated how many points each selection was worth. The feedback was presented 4 s after the onset of the face/objects display. Participants were instructed that they could gain additional points by correctly remembering each character–object preference for a subsequent memory test phase (see below), and that the points would be converted into a monetary bonus at the end of the experiment. \n\nCritically, the feedback was manipulated to yield different average reward levels for the six different characters presented during the memory encoding session. Specifically, while all characters received four −1 feedbacks, two characters associated with high (Hi) average reward received one +1 feedback and five +5 feedbacks, two characters associated with medium (Me) average reward received three +1 feedbacks and three +5 feedbacks, while two characters associated with low (Lo) average reward received five +1 feedbacks and only one +5 feedback (Fig.  ). Each of the six characters was presented together with each of ten possible object pairs (i.e., the object pairs were constant across the experiment and participants), for a total of 60 trials. All ten character–object associations were encoded for one character (i.e., ten trials), before the same object pairs were presented together with the next character, and so forth for all six characters. For each participant, the characters were randomly assigned to one of the different average reward levels (i.e., either Lo, Me, or Hi). \n\nTest session: During the test session, participants were presented with the same characters and same object pairs, and were instructed to recall and select the character's preferred object in each object pair. Selecting an object previously associated with positive feedback (i.e., +1 or +5) earned the corresponding points (i.e., +1 and +5), while rejecting an object associated with −1 feedback earned +1 points. Note that correctly remembering associations encoded during +1 feedback or those encoded during −1 feedback (correct rejection) would yield +1 point in both cases. Participants lost 1 point if they selected a disliked object, i.e., either by selecting a previously disliked object or by not selecting a previously rewarded object. Testing trials were identical to encoding trials (Fig.  ), except that no feedback was provided. The order of characters, object pairs, and the side of object presentation within a pair, were pseudorandomized. First, each character (each with the 10 corresponding object pairs, i.e., 10 trials) was presented once before any other character was repeated. Second, the order of the ten object pairs was randomized for each character. Third, the side of object presentation within a pair was reversed (with respect to the side of presentation during the encoding session) for half of the object pairs for each character. \n\nProcedure: To get familiar with the task, participants first trained the task outside the MRI scanner. Six character–object associations were encoded for one character and then tested after a delay of ~5 min. Neither the character nor the trained object pairs were subsequently used during the main experiment. Participants then performed the associative memory task inside the MRI scanner, as described previously (i.e., one encoding session and one test session). \n\nStatistical analysis: Memory performance during the test session was calculated as the proportion of correct responses: i.e., selection of objects that had been rewarded for a given character during the encoding phase (+1, +5 feedbacks), or rejections of objects classified as “disliked” by a given character (−1 feedback). We computed the number of correct responses for each combination of immediate feedback value (+1, +5, and −1) and average reward (Lo, Me, and Hi). \n\nThe data were analyzed using linear mixed models of the following form:  , where   Y   represents a vector of values of the dependent measure of interest for the   i  th participant,   X   represents a matrix of   p   predictors (independent variables) for the   i  th participant,   B   represents a vector of   p   fixed effect beta weight estimates for each predictor in   X  ,   Z   represents a matrix of   q   random effect predictors,   b   represents a vector of   q   random effect estimates, and   e   represents a vector of the model fit error, representing the discrepancy between the model prediction for each observation from the ith participant and the actual value of that observation. For behavior and modeling data, two categorical predictors with three levels each were used: Feedback value (−1, +1, and +5) and Average reward (Lo, Me, and Hi) along with their interaction. Moreover, each participant was treated as a random variable, i.e., the matrix   Z   contained one column for each participant pertaining to that participant’s random effect estimate   b  . \n\nANOVA was initially used to analyze the results, and significant effects were further investigated using two-tailed paired   t-  tests. Of note, while linear mixed models are in many ways superior compared with alternative approaches , the calculation of standard effect sizes for these models is still heavily debated . For this reason, we restricted the reporting of standardized effects sizes to the difference between means, which was calculated using Cohen’s   d  : \n\n\n### Computational approach \n  \nTo provide a more fine-grained (i.e., trial-wise) analysis of behavior and fMRI data, we created and confronted different computational models for successful memory formation depending on different types of reward available at the time of encoding. As such, the average reward   is calculated using an exponential running average  while the feedback values (fb) are the actual reward values (i.e., −1, +1, or +5): where   v   is a learning rate which determines the integration rate of recent rewards into the overall estimate of current average reward. The probability   p   of successfully encoding information presented in a trial   t   is described by a logistic function:  R  (  t  ) is defined in different models based on previous data linking reward and dopamine to memory formation, as described next. \n\nA “null”-model assumes no influence of reward on memory performance: A second model accounts for the impact of feedback value on memory formation (  C  ): A third model accounts for the hypothesized impact of average reward on memory formation  : A fourth model accounts for independent additive contributions from reward magnitude and average reward: A fifth model also includes their interaction  : A sixth model accounts for the nonlinear modulation of memory formation by increasing average reward  , inspired by the notion that average reward is encoded by tonic dopamine  and the nonlinear modulation of episodic memory formation by increased dopamine levels: where   w   indicates the “optimal” level of average reward, i.e., the point where lower or higher levels of average reward are detrimental to memory encoding. \n\nA seventh and final model is similar to the sixth model, but presumes that average reward levels are calculated for each cartoon character independently. To account for this possibility, an initial level of average reward   was therefore fitted across cartoon characters. \n\n C  ,  ,  , and   regulate the modulation of overall reward levels by reward magnitude, average reward, their interaction, and the nonlinear modulation by average reward, respectively. The free parameters   were fitted to each participant’s data through maximum likelihood estimation, i.e., by minimizing the negative log-likelihood estimation function (LLE) for logistic regression: where   y  (  t  ) is the observed outcome (i.e., hit/miss) in each trial   t  . To validate and confront these models, their fit to behavioral data were compared using AIC  which accounts for different numbers of fitted variables: \n\n\n### MRI data \n  \nImage acquisition: MRI images were acquired using a 3T whole body MRI scanner (Trio TIM, Siemens, Germany) with a 12-channel head coil. Standard structural images were acquired with a T1 weighted 3D sequence (MPRAGE, TR/TI/TE = 1900/900/2.27 ms, flip angle = 9°, voxel dimensions = 1 mm isotropic, 256 × 256 × 192 voxels). Proton density (PD) structural images were acquired with a turbo spin echo sequence (TR/TE = 6000/8.4 ms, flip angle = 149°, voxel dimensions = 0.8 × 0.8 × 3 mm, 205 × 205 × 60 voxels). The PD scan was used to confirm the location of VTA activation, as it allows the identification of the substantia nigra, a brain region located just laterally to the VTA . The acquisition volume was oriented in order to scan the brain from the lower part of the pons to the top of the thalamus. Functional images were acquired with a susceptibility weighted EPI sequence (TR/TE = 2100/30 ms, flip angle = 80°, voxel dimensions = 3.2 mm isotropic, 64 × 64 × 36 voxels). \n\nMRI data analysis: Functional MRI data were preprocessed and then analyzed using the general linear model for event-related designs in SPM8 (Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK;  ). During preprocessing, all functional volumes were realigned to the mean image, co-registered to the structural T1 image, corrected for slice timing, normalized to the MNI EPI-template (via a 12 parameter affine transformation model with trilinear interpolation), and smoothed using an 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Statistical analyses were performed on a voxelwise basis across the whole-brain. At the first-level analysis, individual events were modeled by a standard synthetic hemodynamic response function (HRF) and six rigid-body realignment parameters were included as nuisance covariates when estimating statistical maps. Contrasts (see below) were then calculated and the contrast images entered into second-level   t   tests implemented in SPM. \n\nParametric modulation by model-derived reward parameters: By fitting computational models to memory performance from the test session, we obtained parameters that best explained how changes in feedback value and average reward during memory encoding influenced subsequent memory performance . Combining fitted model parameters with fMRI data, we could then trace back the neural correlates of those distinct dimensions of reward (that we manipulated in the task) during associative memory encoding. \n\nTo this end, we created an event-related design that included three event-types modeled as stick functions (i.e., with a 0 duration) that were respectively time-locked to the onset of the display of character/object pairs, the button press of the response, and the feedback in each trial. We then added trial-by-trial estimates of model-derived reward parameters, i.e., feedback values (i.e., −1, +1, and +5) and average reward levels (calculated as an exponential running average of feedback values), as parametric modulators to the feedback onset times. To disentangle neural activity related to different parametric modulators, the vectors containing respective parametric modulator were orthogonalized. This process allows studying the neural correlates of one parametric modulator independently of another . \n\nFunctional connectivity analysis of VTA–ACC interactions: For the connectivity analysis, we used the gPPI approach which has the benefit of accommodating multiple task conditions, including parametric modulators, in the same connectivity model . Physiological variables were created by extracting the deconvolved times series from each seed ROI. Psychological regressors were created by convolving each onset regressor and parametric modulator with the canonical HRF. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) terms (which allow the identification of voxels showing task-dependent covariation with the seed ROIs) were created by multiplying the time series from the psychological regressors with the physiological variable. All of the above was performed for each participant separately, and individual gPPI models were created by including the corresponding physiological variables, the psychological regressors, and the PPI terms. \n\nRegions of interest (ROIs): The selection of a priori ROIs used for small volume corrections (SVCs) were guided by previous literature on reward-related memory enhancements , reporting the involvement of memory-related brain structures such as the HC and the PHG, as well as structures coding for reward, such as the NAcc, the VTA, and the dACC. \n\nROIs for the NAcc, HC, and the PHG were obtained from the WFU toolbox . The VTA ROI was obtained from a recently published probabilistic atlas of the VTA, by including voxels identified as being part of the VTA in 50% of participants . The dACC ROI was defined by limiting the ACC ROI of the WFU toolbox to   z   > +12 and   y   > +16 . A “reward mask” was created by combining the NAcc and VTA ROIs, while a “memory mask” was created by combining the HC and the PHG ROIs. Both of these masks were used to test the parametric modulation by feedback value and average reward. By contrast, the dACC ROI was only used to test specific hypotheses related to VTA–dACC interactions. For visualization purposes, an amygdala ROI obtained from the WFU toolbox was included in some of the figures. \n\nAdditional post-hoc analyses tested the involvement of the amygdala by using SVCs on a ROI mask of the bilateral amygdala obtained from the SPM Anatomy Toolbox Version 3.0 (all sub-regions of the amygdala included in the mask) . \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nThe obtained results are displayed using a threshold of   p   < 0.001 and a minimum cluster size of ten contiguous voxels, unless otherwise reported. SVCs using a threshold of   p   < 0.05 family-wise error rate (FWER) for multiple comparisons were obtained using a priori ROI masks reported above. Bonferroni-corrected statistical thresholds were applied to two post-hoc tests that investigated the involvement of the amygdala. Specifically, because two post-hoc tests were performed, the statistical threshold was corrected to 0.017 (0.05/3) for these tests. Conditions were compared using paired   t  -tests, as implemented in SPM. \n\nFor display purposes, the average brain activity were extracted from 3-mm spheres centered on peak voxels within significant clusters of activation and shown as insets. While the feedback values were constant (−1, +1, and +5), average reward levels changed continuously between trials. For this reason, we calculated and displayed the average brain activity within three equally sized bins of average reward levels, i.e., the 0–33rd percentiles, 34–66th percentiles, and 67−100th percentiles. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the   linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"6db26620fd03c96c4352fc9459e3c20a"}

However, some basic psychophysical tasks in visual perception do not give rise to this expected effect, at least not in the visual cortex. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record brain activity while systematically manipulating task difficulty in a motion discrimination task, by varying the angular difference between the motion direction of random dots and a reference direction. We used both a blocked and an event-related design, and presented stimuli in both central and peripheral vision. The behavioral psychometric function, across angular differences of 3°, 9°, 15°, or 80°, spanned the full response range, as expected. The mean blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals were also correlated within-participants between the blocked and event-related designs, across all brain areas tested. Within the visual cortex, the voxel response patterns correlated more within-conditions (e.g., 3° and 3°) than between-conditions (e.g., 3° and 9°), in both designs, further attesting to the reasonable quality of the BOLD data. Nevertheless, the BOLD-o-metric functions (i.e., BOLD activity as a function of task difficulty) were flat in the whole-brain and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, including in the visual cortex, the parietal cortex, in both designs, and in foveal and peripheral visual fields alike. Indeed, there was little difference between BOLD activity during the 3° and 80° conditions. Some suggestive evidence of difficulty modulation was revealed only in the superior and inferior frontal gyri for the blocked design. We conclude that, in motion discrimination, there is no systematic BOLD modulation that accompanies the standard psychometric function across different hierarchies of cortical areas, except for the frontal lobe of the brain. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nTask difficulty has been found to qualitatively change the way the brain functions, according to the existing literature. The reverse hierarchy theory of visual perceptual learning, proposed by Ahissar, Hochstein [ ], suggests that different visual hierarchies, involved with the learning of easy tasks and difficult tasks, show generalization and specificity, respectively. Other perceptual learning studies provided further evidence of a difficulty effect by showing different learning and transfer effects for easy and difficult tasks, across multiple task types such as motion discrimination [ , ] and orientation discrimination [ ]. These behavioral effects suggested that brain activity was likely also modulated by task difficulty and raised an important question concerning the neural processing of visual stimuli. \n\nBrain imaging studies have shown that task difficulty affects brain activity in a variety of tasks. fMRI studies have suggested that, in general, task difficulty changes the BOLD responses mostly in frontal and parietal cortices. For example, in a working memory task, activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and other regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was found to increase with increasing task difficulty, manipulated by adjusting the degree of stimulus degradation [ ]. Attentional load related difficulty in a visual tracking task was also found to affect the activation in the parietal and frontal cortical areas, including the superior frontal sulcus (SFS) [ ]. Other studies concerning the effect of task difficulty on neural responses consistently demonstrated that the responses of frontal, parietal, and cingulate cortices were affected by task difficulty, across a variety of cognitive tasks including working memory [ , , ], language [ – ], time perception [ , ], and visual attention [ , ]. Generally speaking, the frontal lobe was recruited in diverse cognitive demands and thus showed sensitivity to task difficulty [ ]. \n\nIn addition to fMRI studies, electroencephalograph (EEG) studies showed that when an oddball task became more difficult (as the sizes of target and distractor stimuli became more similar), the distractor P3a amplitude increased while the target P3b amplitude decreased [ ]. The generators of these P3 components were suggested to lie bilaterally in the frontal, parietal, and temporal areas using fMRI-constrained source analyses [ ]. Besides P3a and P3b, the amplitude of another late component termed D220 was found directly proportional to the difficulty levels of decision making [ ], which indicated that difficulty might influence the late stage of visual processing. Furthermore, a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study in 107 subjects also showed that significant increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ACC were more likely to occur during difficult tasks [ ]. Converging evidence, therefore, demonstrates the close relationship between task difficulty and neural activity in higher-level cortical areas such as the frontal, parietal, and cingulate cortices, in multiple tasks. \n\nPrevious studies investigating task difficulty focused primarily on the frontal and parietal cortices, outside the sensory cortex. The current evidence as to whether task difficulty modulates the activity of lower-level visual cortices, however, is less consistent. A single-cell recording study in rhesus monkey V4 neurons showed that neuronal responses to stimuli became larger and more selective when the visual discrimination task was more difficult [ ]. However, ultimately the increasing amount of attention, rather than discrimination difficulty, was found to enhance the responsiveness and selectivity of the neurons processing the stimulus. The influence of task difficulty on rhesus monkey V1 neurons was also modulated by spatial attention, with an increase in firing rate at the focus of attention and a suppression in surrounding regions [ ]. In addition to neurophysiological studies, fMRI results showed that the base responses in V1, V2, and V3 depended on task difficulty, with activity decreasing as the pattern-detection task became easier [ ]. However, several other fMRI studies suggested that task difficulty did not change the BOLD responses. Sunaert et al. [ ] found that increasing the difficulty of a motion speed discrimination task had little effect on the BOLD responses in visual areas. Only dorsal V3 showed a weak difficulty effect. Furthermore, Ganis et al. [ ] found that no activation in the brain could be predicted by the response time (an indicator of task difficulty) of visual imagery and visual perception tasks. Other fMRI studies, using ROI analyses, also showed a null effect of task difficulty on the activity in the human visual cortex. For example, manipulation of the angular size in an orientation discrimination task gave rise to flat BOLD responses in V1, V2, V3a, V3b, and V4 [ , ]. Taking these findings together, there is still no consensus about the effect of task difficulty on the neural responses in the visual cortex. \n\nAt present, brain imaging studies mainly rely on univariate analysis and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to quantify the effect of some variable on brain activity. In visual discrimination tasks, difficulty is often increased by decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the stimuli, thus requiring more effort and more attentional resources from the participant. As a result, greater brain activation is expected to take place as measured by the fMRI BOLD peak. The current study was designed to test whether there is a systematic univariate change in brain activity as a function of the difficulty of a motion discrimination task, as defined by the angular difference in motion direction discrimination. Note that the meaning of task difficulty varies greatly, depending on how it is defined in a specific task. The motion discrimination difficulty has never been studied by fMRI previously. Therefore, although we would expect a similar modulation effect in the frontal and parietal cortex, such an effect is not necessarily guaranteed, since no existing evidence supports the difficulty effect per our definition of difficulty. \n\nThe difficulty effect found in previous studies may result from the ways in which they manipulated task difficulty. These manipulations may not only vary the difficulty levels, but also introduce confounding factors such as different perceptual loads or different physical properties of stimuli (e.g., contrast, coherence level in dot motion). In addition, previous studies testing the effect of task difficulty may have focused only on the visual cortex [ , ]. Furthermore, it is not known how the trial-structure of an experiment (e.g., blocked versus event-related design) affects attentional load. More specifically, in a blocked design, the attentional demand may be different between an easy and a difficult block. In an event-related design, however, since the difficulty level of each trial is unpredictable, the attentional demand is expected to be approximately equal between easy and difficult trials. In the current study, we adopted a motion direction discrimination task, where task difficulty was manipulated by changing the directional difference between a motion stimulus and a reference. This manipulation kept the physical stimuli nearly the same between different difficulty levels. Using fMRI, we measured brain activity across visual cortical areas in both the ventral and dorsal visual streams, and in multiple higher-order cortices. We also performed a whole-brain analysis to search for difficulty-level-related areas across the entire brain. In addition to these univariate analyses, we also performed MVPA to investigate the activity patterns in the visual cortex at different difficulty levels. We presented stimuli both in the fovea and in the periphery (in a supplementary experiment), to further inspect the difference between foveal and peripheral visual processing. An additional series of analyses, including applying spatial smoothing to fMRI data, comparing between the easiest and most difficult conditions directly, conducting denoising methods to improve fMRI data, as well as selecting the best participants and better ROIs, were implemented for further investigation into our data (see Supplemental Material 5). \n\nOur results showed that even though the activity patterns in the visual cortex changed with different difficulty levels in the MVPA analysis, the brain activity as measured by univariate BOLD signals was invariant to task difficulty across different hierarchies of cortical areas, except for some superior and inferior frontal areas in the blocked design. In the visual cortex, the null effect of task difficulty was robust for both blocked and event-related designs, and in both foveal and peripheral visual fields. \n\n\n## 2. Experimental procedures and results \n  \n### 2.1. Experimental procedures \n  \nDuring fMRI scanning, 24 participants (14 for Experiment 1, 10 for Experiment 2; 9 males) performed a motion direction discrimination task, in which they judged whether the motion direction of a random-dot kinematogram (RDK) stimulus was clock- or counter-clockwise relative to a static reference direction ( ). Four more participants performed a Supplementary Experiment, in which the RDK was presented in an annular region in the peripheral visual field, instead of the foveal visual field ( ). The task difficulty was manipulated by changing the angular difference between the reference and RDK directions (3°, 9°, and 15° in Experiment 1; 3°, 9°, 15°, and 80° in Experiment 2 and Supplementary Experiment). Both blocked and event-related designs were applied in all three experiments. All participants gave written, informed consent in accordance with the procedures and protocols approved by the human subject review committee of Peking University, Beijing, China. \n   Stimulus and schematic description of a trial.  \n(A) Experiments 1 and 2: In each 3 sec trial, a cross was first presented at the center of the screen for 600ms. Its longer arm indicates the reference direction. After this reference, an RDK motion stimulus in a circular region with a radius of 4° was presented for 200ms. Participants discriminated whether the motion direction was clockwise or counterclockwise of the reference. The motion directions of RDK were 3°, 9°, 15° from the reference in Experiment 1, and 3°, 9°, 15°, 80° from the reference in Experiment 2, corresponding to the three and four levels of difficulty. (B) Supplementary Experiment: The moving dots of RDK were restricted to an annular region with an outer radius of 8° and an inner radius of 4°. The stimuli and experimental design were otherwise the same as in Experiment 2. \n  \n\n### 2.2. Behavioral results \n  \nIn Experiment 1, we measured participants’ accuracy (percent correct choices) across the three difficulty levels (3°, 9°, and 15°), separately for the blocked and event-related designs. The accuracies averaged across all participants for the 3°, 9°, 15° conditions were 60.9%, 77.4%, 87.3%, respectively, for the blocked design (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2, 26) = 114.9, p < 0.001; post-hoc paired t-test, all t(13) > 7.8, p < 0.001) ( ); and 62.8%, 79.7%, 88.2% for the event-related design (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2, 26) = 117.0, p < 0.001; post-hoc paired t-test, all t(13) > 6.2, p < 0.001) ( ). In Experiment 2 there were four difficulty levels (3°, 9°, 15°, and 80°) for both blocked and event-related designs. The accuracies averaged across all participants for the 3°, 9°, 15°, 80° conditions were 57.5%, 74.5%, 85.1%, 96.0% for the blocked design (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(3, 21) = 121.2, p < 0.001; post-hoc paired t-test, all t(7) > 5.3, p < 0.001) ( ); and 59.1%, 74.9%, 84.1%, 95.4% for the event-related design (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(3, 21) = 124.4, p < 0.001; post-hoc paired t-test, all t(7) > 5.1, p < 0.001) ( ). \n   Behavioral results: Experiments 1 and 2.  \nBehavioral accuracies averaged across 14 participants in 3°, 9°, and 15° conditions for the blocked (A) and event-related (B) designs in Experiment 1; and across 10 participants in 3°, 9°, 15°, and 80° conditions for the blocked (C) and event-related (D) designs in Experiment 2. Error bars denote 1 SEM of the mean here and in all subsequent figures. \n  \nBehavioral results from Experiments 1 and 2 consistently showed that performance for both blocked and event-related designs significantly improved as the angular difference increased. Behavioral results from the Supplementary Experiment followed the same pattern, as shown in supporting information ( ). \n\n\n### 2.3. MRI data analysis and data quality \n  \nWe defined visual cortex ROIs in V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+, and IPS; and 42 spherical ROIs in the higher-order cortex, using the method specified in Supplemental Material 4. For the blocked design, we extracted BOLD signals by averaging the data across voxels in each pre-defined ROI, and then used a general linear model (GLM) to estimate the beta value for each ROI and each task difficulty condition. For the event-related design, we again averaged BOLD signals within each ROI, then normalized to average signal intensity and the base-line response was subtracted from the response to test stimuli. Finally, the peak of the response time course was obtained for each ROI and each condition, as a measure of activation level. In order to examine the consistency of our results between the blocked design and event-related design, we calculated the Pearson correlation between the beta values from the blocked design and the response peak magnitudes from the event-related design, across all the ROIs, participants, and difficulty conditions, separately for Experiments 1 and 2. As shown in  , the BOLD activity was similar between the blocked and event-related designs (r  = 0.68 in Experiment 1, and 0.49 in Experiment 2), demonstrating the robustness and stability of MRI data across the two experimental designs. \n   Correlation between blocked data and event-related data.  \nPearson correlation between beta values for the blocked design and response peaks for the event-related design in Experiment 1 (A) and in Experiment 2 (B) (blue: 3°, green: 9°, red: 15°, hollow yellow circle: 80°). \n  \n\n### 2.4. Difficulty of motion direction discrimination task revealed in the visual cortex with MVPA \n  \nTo account for the possibility that task difficulty is represented by a more complex code within an ROI than can be detected with univariate methods, we implemented an additional MVPA analysis on the blocked design data. Specifically, we correlated the multi-voxel activity patterns between different blocks, either of the same difficulty level or of different difficulty levels. If the neural representations of motion stimuli are changed by task difficulty, then the correlation between activity patterns in blocks of different difficulty levels (between-condition correlation) should be smaller than the correlation between activity patterns in blocks of the same difficulty level (within-condition correlation). Otherwise, if difficulty does not modulate multi-variate BOLD activity, there should be no significant difference between the within-condition correlation and between-condition correlation. This analysis was run separately on each of the seven visual ROIs described earlier, to determine which ROIs, if any, were modulated by task difficulty. The MVPA results showed that in all seven visual cortical ROIs, the within-condition correlations were significantly greater than between-condition correlations in Experiment 1 (all paired t > 4.5, p < 0.001) ( ) and in Experiment 2 (all paired t > 8.1, p < 0.001) ( ), suggesting that difficulty level is represented in the neural activity of these brain regions. \n   MVPA results.  \nThe correlation between activity patterns of motion stimuli within the same condition was larger than that between different conditions in Experiment 1 (A) and in Experiment 2 (B). \n  \n\n### 2.5. Univariate ROI analysis as a function of task difficulty \n  \nAs described in section 2.3, we obtained BOLD amplitudes at each of seven visual cortical ROIs and during each condition (difficulty level; 3°, 9°, and 15° in Experiment 1; and 3°, 9°, 15°, and 80° in Experiment 2), for both the blocked design (beta values estimated with a GLM) and event-related design (peak response of the time course measured as the signal percentage change). A repeated-measures ANOVA on BOLD amplitudes was performed with task difficulty as the within-participant factor in each ROI, and for both the blocked and event-related designs. In Experiment 1, the main effect of difficulty was not significant in any ROI for either design, i.e., there was no significant difference in the activation strength among three levels of task difficulty (the blocked design: all F(2, 26) < 2.7, p > 0.05,  ; the event-related design: all F(2, 26) < 0.97, p > 0.05,  ). Similarly, in Experiment 2, the main effect of difficulty was not significant in any ROI (the blocked design: all F(3, 21) < 2.2, p > 0.05,  ; the event-related design: all F(3, 21) < 2.1, p > 0.05,  ). The time courses of the BOLD signal for the event-related design are shown in Supplemental Material 3. In sum, the univariate analyses indicated that difficulty of the motion direction discrimination task did not systematically influence average cortical activations in the visual cortical areas, in either the blocked or event-related designs. \n   MRI results of ROI analysis: Experiment 1.  \nBOLD amplitudes averaged across 14 participants for the 3°, 9°, and 15° conditions in V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+, and IPS for the blocked design (A) and the event-related design (B). \n     MRI results of ROI analysis: Experiment 2.  \nBOLD amplitudes averaged across 10 participants for the 3°, 9°, 15°, and 80° conditions in V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+, and IPS for the blocked design (A) and the event-related design (B). \n  \nFor higher-order cortical ROIs, 42 spherical ROIs were defined based on Talairach coordinates that had been found to be modulated by task difficulty in previous literatures ( ). This same analysis was applied to all 42 ROIs for the blocked and event-related designs in Experiments 1 and 2. Again, no ROI displayed significant differences of BOLD amplitude across task difficulty conditions for either design (all p > 0.05, FDR corrected), suggesting that task difficulty did not affect activation strength in these regions either. \n   The 42 Talairach coordinates for ROI analysis in the higher-order cortex.        \n\n### 2.6. Univariate whole brain analysis as a function of task difficulty \n  \nBeyond our selected ROIs, we searched for any area in the entire brain that may show a task difficulty effect. We compared the BOLD signal at each voxel of the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) atlas brain between the different difficulty levels (3°, 9°, and 15° in Experiment 1; 3°, 9°, 15°, and 80° in Experiment 2), for both blocked and event-related designs. However, we did not find any voxels showing a significant difference between these conditions (p > 0.05, FDR corrected), across either experiment. \n\n\n### 2.7. Correlation between behavioral and neural responses \n  \nIn order to investigate the relationship between behavior (accuracy and response latency) and neural activity, we compared the BOLD signal during “correct” and “incorrect” trials, and separately correlated BOLD amplitude with behavioral response times. No significant difference in BOLD activity was found between “correct” and “incorrect” responses in any of the 49 ROIs (7 visual cortical ROIs and 42 higher-order cortical ROIs) (all p > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), suggesting that these brain regions did not influence the accuracy of motion detection during the task. To evaluate the correlation between BOLD activity and behavioral response times, a Fisher-transformation was applied to the correlation coefficients to obtain z values. Only 3 out of 49 ROIs exhibited a correlation with z values being larger than 0.1 in both experiments (Experiment 1: z = 0.11 in IPS, z = 0.18 in ROI 1, z = 0.19 in ROI 7; Experiment 2: z = 0.11 in IPS, z = 0.12 in ROI 1, z = 0.17 in ROI 7). High correlations between behavioral response time and neural activity were found in IPS, ROI 1 (located at the right precuneus), and ROI 7 (located at the left anterior cingulate gyrus). \n\n\n### 2.8. Supplementary experiment results \n  \nThe behavioral and MRI results of the Supplementary Experiment, in which the stimuli were presented in the peripheral visual field, were consistent with Experiments 1 and 2 (  and   Figs). Despite the lack of statistical testing (due to the limited number of participants), the flat function of BOLD response against task difficulty in the Supplementary Experiment followed the same pattern as that in Experiments 1 and 2, in which the stimuli were presented in the foveal visual field. This serves as further support that task difficulty does not affect neural activity in the visual cortex, regardless of whether it was foveal or peripheral visual processing. \n\n\n### 2.9. Additional analyses \n  \nIn order to ensure that our null effects from the univariate analyses were not driven by particular parameters chosen in our analysis methods, we performed additional data analyses, including using spatially smoothed fMRI data, comparing 3° and 80° conditions directly, using fMRI data denoised by Kay et al. [ ]’s method, as well as selecting the best participants’ data and better ROIs to analyze. The methods and results are in Supplemental Material 5. \n\nWe replicated our findings of null effect from the entire participant group when we re-ran our analyses using only the four best participants (based on behavioral performance and imaging data quality). An additional analysis using spatially smoothed data revealed only one ROI significantly modulated by task difficulty. However, given the weak activation level at this ROI, the evidence from this particular analysis appears not very strong. The ROI analysis using denoised data revealed a significant difficulty effect (BOLD response decreased as task difficulty decreased. Figs B and C in  ) at ROI 7, located at the left anterior cingulate gyrus, for only the event-related design. Finally, we combined data from Experiments 1 and 2 and performed ROI analysis across all 24 participants. ROI 30, which was located in the basal ganglia, was found to be significantly modulated by task difficulty (BOLD response increased as task difficulty decreased.   and   Figs) in the blocked design only. These significant results occurred in one of the two designs but not consistently across both, providing only some suggestive effects of task difficulty rather than a robust conclusion. \n\nTo avoid a possibly overly conservative criterion when a large number of candidate ROIs were used, we selected the six ROIs that showed difficulty modulation in Sunaert et al. [ ]’s study. The task used by Sunaert et al. [ ] was motion speed perception, which was most similar to our own task in the entire literature on brain imaging of task difficulty. Here, difficulty modulation was indeed found when data from Experiment 1 were analyzed, or when the combined data from both Experiments 1 and 2 were analyzed. Data from Experiment 2 alone did not yield statistical significance. This is suggestive evidence that task difficulty as defined in our motion direction task could modulate BOLD activation in the frontal lobe of the brain. \n\n\n\n## 3. Discussion \n  \n### 3.1. A Flat BOLD response in the visual cortex against task difficulty in the fovea and periphery \n  \nIn the current study, we investigated the effect of task difficulty (of motion direction discrimination) on BOLD activity across the entire brain. In Experiment 1, three levels of difficulty were adopted by manipulating the angular difference between the direction of a reference and a motion stimulus (RDK). Psychophysical results showed that the accuracy robustly increased as task difficulty decreased, across all participants. In contrast, our univariate fMRI results showed a flat BOLD response across task difficulty levels in seven pre-defined visual areas (V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+, and IPS), and for both event-related and blocked designs. In Experiment 2, we extended the range of task difficulty to an extremely easy level in which the angular difference in each trial was so large that little demand was required for the participants to perform this task. However, we still did not find any significant modulation of BOLD activity by difficulty level at any of the above seven visual ROIs, using the same univariate approach. In addition to the seven visual cortical areas, we also examined 42 spherical ROIs, defined manually based on previous literature. However, no significant difference in BOLD activity was found as a function of difficulty, at any of these higher-order cortical ROIs. Even when we examined the activation difference between 3° and 80° conditions directly, there was still no significant difference. The whole brain search similarly did not identify any voxels whose activity was significantly modulated by task difficulty. The null result was consistent across Experiments 1 and 2, and in both blocked and event-related designs. \n\nGiven the possibility that foveal visual processing might be different from peripheral visual processing, we performed a supplementary experiment, in which stimuli were presented only in the peripheral visual field, with a blank circular area in the center. Although the number of participants (four) in the Supplementary Experiment was not enough for statistical analysis, the activations in all the seven visual cortical ROIs showed the same tendency as in Experiments 1 and 2; namely, that there was no obvious difference in brain activity between the three or four task difficulty levels. These consistent activation patterns further supported the conclusion that task difficulty did not affect brain activity, regardless of the location of the visual field in which stimuli were presented. \n\n\n### 3.2. Different multi-variate patterns across difficulty conditions \n  \nIn addition to investigating the univariate BOLD activation levels at individual ROIs, as a function of task difficulty, we also explored the influence of task difficulty on neural response patterns using an MVPA method. MVPA of fMRI data is more sensitive and more informative about the functional organization of cortex than univariate analysis is with the GLM [ ]. This method revealed that the multi-voxel patterns within each of the seven visual ROIs were more correlated within-condition (i.e., blocks of the same difficulty level) than between-condition (i.e., blocks of different difficulty levels), suggesting that difficulty affected the subtle neural patterns induced by motion stimuli. Considering the failure to find difficulty-related effects using univariate methods, we can assume that task difficulty (here manipulated by the angular difference in a motion direction discrimination task) modulated neural responses by changing the patterns of activity in the visual cortex, in contrast to simpler univariate measures that indicate the extent to which a cortical field or system is globally engaged [ ]. \n\n\n### 3.3. Denoised data revealed the ACC and basal ganglia modulated by task difficulty \n  \nSome additional analyses were performed, including using spatially smoothed fMRI data and denoised data (Supplemental Material 5). However, after extensive effort to search for univariate BOLD activation modulation by task difficulty, the only brain areas we could find were the basal ganglia, which was found in previous literature to be a major structure for processing internal reward information [ – ]; and the anterior cingulate gyrus, which was found to be robustly correlated with task difficulty by a PET study across multiple tasks [ ] and an fMRI study in a paired associates learning task [ ]. Activity in the left anterior cingulate gyrus decreased as task difficulty decreased (Figs B and C in  ), suggesting that anterior cingulate gyrus activity is positively correlated with task difficulty. On the other hand, activity in the basal ganglion increased as task difficulty decreased (  and   Figs). This negative correlation may be because lower difficulty levels lead to higher behavioral accuracy, and thus higher reward, which may lead to higher neural responses in reward-related areas. These two ROIs were initially selected because they were demonstrated to be associated with task difficulty in previous literature [ , ]. Denoising the fMRI data helped reveal some suggestive effects caused by difficulty and internal rewards in higher-order cortices. Nevertheless, the findings were not robust as they were not consistent across two designs. \n\n\n### 3.4. The frontal areas with suggestive difficulty effect implied default mode network activities \n  \nA suggestive task difficulty effect was revealed in some superior and inferior frontal areas when a limited number of ROIs were selected (see Supplemental Material 5). Their negative activities during task engagement, especially for the blocked design, implied their possible involvement in the default mode network (DMN) activities. \n\n\n### 3.5. The IPS, precuneus, and ACC Activities were correlated with response times \n  \nHigh correlations between behavioral response time and neural activity in IPS, the right precuneus, and the left anterior cingulate gyrus suggest that these areas may influence the participants’ ability to discriminate the stimuli, and thus would be associated with the participants’ behavioral responses. This behavior-BOLD correlation is in accord with the Drift diffusion model of perceptual decision-making [ , ], which demonstrates a critical link between cognitive state and IPS activity [ , ]. The model posits that the IPS accumulates evidence from ventral temporal cortex over time and exhibits an activity level that is monotonically related to accumulation time. Although the neural activity was not correlated with task difficulty directly, it was significantly correlated with behavioral response time, found in previous literature and also supported by our results. This correlation might be due to the accumulation of activity at middle visual processing stages, instead of the task difficulty itself. On the other hand, behavioral accuracy was not significantly correlated with neural activation. Another fMRI study using modeling also demonstrated accumulator regions in the MT+, the IPS, and the inferior frontal sulcus that were modulated by task difficulty in a motion coherence task [ ]. We can assume that changes in motion direction deviation might activate similar but not completely the same accumulators activated by stimulus strength (changes in motion coherence versus stimulus contrast). \n\n\n### 3.6. Different designs elicited different results from previous studies \n  \nOur null effect of difficulty measured by univariate BOLD levels, in the visual cortex and most higher-order cortical areas found in the main analyses are in contradiction with some of the existing literature. A common assumption in previous studies was that participants might pay more attention to difficult stimuli and thus show a larger response in the visual cortex. Consistent with this assumption and introduced in the introduction, an electrophysiological study found that the response amplitude and selectivity of V4 neurons were both enhanced in difficult blocks compared to easy blocks [ ]; an fMRI study found that V1 responses decreased as the task became easier [ ]; another fMRI study discovered a significant correlation between neural activity in the frontal and parietal cortices and task difficulty in a visual tracking task [ ]; some fusiform and occipital areas also showed a significant correlation with difficulty [ ]. Note that these studies may not have independently manipulated task difficulty and attention on purpose. As a result, the effect of difficulty might be confounded with that of attention. Boudreau et al. [ ] manipulated difficulty and attention separately in a detection task and found that the increase of difficulty only caused a modest increase in the response of V4 neurons. Other fMRI studies introduced in the introduction, in which attention was controlled carefully, also demonstrated that the activity of human early visual cortex and regions in the ventral stream were not affected by difficulty [ ]; a whole brain search showed that activity in visual cortex could not be predicted by reaction times in perceptual tasks [ ]. These pieces of evidence indicate that neural activity in the visual cortex might not be affected by task difficulty when attention is controlled properly, which is consistent with our results. The task design that we adopted in the current study focused on difficulty level itself, without changing participants’ attentional efforts purposely. In the event-related design experiment, participants were unable to predict the angular difference in each trial, and therefore they were probably not allocating their attention differently across different trials. If we find BOLD being modulated by task difficulty in the blocked design experiment, it might be attributed to the possibility that participants may have attended differently in anticipation of the block’s difficulty and thus there is a confound. In our case, we only found suggestive modulation for the blocked design in the negatively activated frontal lobe areas, when a targeted analysis was performed in some specific ROIs. Therefore, we could assume that if there is any anticipatory attention related modulation, its effect is weak enough across the task-activated brain areas such that no statistical significance could be found; while in the frontal lobe (likely part of the DMN) with negative activations, significant modulation was found as a function of the task difficulty in the blocked design experiment. Regarding the task-activated responses we acknowledge that the lack of an effect on difficulty does not mean that the effect does not exist. It is always possible that the difficulty effect existed but was too weak for us to find in our experimental paradigm. Nevertheless, we have tried the best using different task designs and analysis methods, including checking the quality of the data. Yet the null results remained. This means that, even if the difficulty effect existed, it was too weak for our experimental paradigm to detect it. \n\n\n### 3.7. Our results contributed to better understanding on brain responses to task difficulty \n  \nIn the introduction, we presented a prior fMRI study on orientation discrimination that showed that difficulty did not affect the activity across early visual areas including V1, V2, V3, and V4 [ ]; and another study [ ] showing a similar null effect of difficulty, when external noise was added to the stimuli. Now with our study drawing a similar conclusion with these previous studies, we can put the results together for a more comprehensive overview. First, our study measured the fMRI responses to motion stimuli, while Li et al. [ ] studied orientation discrimination of gating stimuli. The task difficulty in the current study refers to the difficulty level manipulated by directional deviation in a motion direction discrimination task. Second, we investigated the responses in more brain areas than Li et al. [ ]’s study. Beyond early visual areas, we examined mid-level and high-level areas such as MT+, IPS, and many spherical ROIs in higher-order cortices. Third, we measured fMRI responses in both the blocked and event-related designs. Lastly, we performed a series of systematic analyses as well as a supplementary experiment to verify the robustness of our analysis results and also investigate into the results with suggestive meanings. In summary, we believe that our results have contributed substantially to the understanding of brain responses as modulated by task difficulty. \n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"5cf814f10dc4d2d8e4aeaea49f8419a3"}

This seeming inconsistency may reflect differences in the psychological constructs examined across studies. We hypothesized that behavioral tasks/contrasts engaging internally and externally driven processes are each associated with age-related decreases and increases, respectively, in cerebral activations. We examined the fMRI data of 103 healthy adults, 18–72 years of age, performing a stop signal task (SST), in which a frequent “go” signal triggered a prepotent response and a less frequent “stop” signal prompted inhibition of this response. Greater internally driven processes lead to stop successes (SS) as compared to stop errors (SE), and to speeding up instead of slowing down in go trials. Conversely, externally driven processes contribute to SE trials, which resulted from habitual, unmonitored responses triggered by the go signal (as compared to SS trials), and involved perceptual and cognitive processes elicited by the stop signal (as compared to go trials). Consistent with our hypothesis, the results showed age-related decreases and increases in cerebral activations each during these respective internally and externally driven processes. These findings further elucidate the influence of age on cognitive functioning and provide an additional perspective to understand the imaging literature of aging. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAge is associated with changes in cognitive performance (Cabeza,  ; Park and Reuter-Lorenz,  ). Numerous functional imaging studies examined the neural bases of such changes and described increased or decreased regional brain activations in older as compared to younger adults. Extant literature reported predominantly decreased cerebral activation when the tasks or psychological contrasts reflect internally driven processes. These internally driven processes direct attention to relevant information as dictated by goals, memory mechanisms such as encoding and recalling, switching of response strategy, anticipation, and shifting of attention as instructed by an endogenous cue (Posner,  ; Posner and Petersen,  ; Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Hahn et al.,  ; Gazzaley and D'Esposito,  ; Pattyn et al.,  ). For instance, comparing active recall with simple recognition of words, Cabeza et al. ( ) and Johnson et al. ( ) reported age-related decreases in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) activation. Thomsen et al. ( ) reported age-related decreases in DLPFC activation when participants were cued endogenously to shift attention to one ear in a dichotic-listening task. When participants maintained eye fixation while covertly attending to a peripheral target, prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia decreased activations in older as compared to younger adults (Solbakk et al.,  ). In a continuous performance task, Braver and Barch ( ) showed age-related decreases in left DLPFC activation during the delay period. Age-related decreases in cortical activations were also observed in the left DLPFC as well as other frontal and parietal structures during verbal and face encoding, where internally driven processes predominate in these tasks (Grady et al.,  ; Logan et al.,  ; Nyberg et al.,  ; Otsuka et al.,  ). \n\nIn contrast, age-related increased activations are frequently observed when the behavioral tasks or contrasts involve processes that are predominantly externally driven, as when attention is drawn to salient or novel stimuli that appear suddenly or unpredictably during target recognition and reflexive eye movements (Posner,  ; Posner and Petersen,  ; Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Hahn et al.,  ; Gazzaley and D'Esposito,  ; Pattyn et al.,  ). For instance, compared to younger adults, older people demonstrated increased activation during word recognition than recall in the right anterior DLPFC (Cabeza et al.,  ; Jimura and Braver,  ). In recognition of famous vs. non-famous people's names, older adults showed greater activation in the left medial PFC, left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and right hippocampus (Nielson et al.,  ). Bilateral frontal and supplementary eye fields showed age-related increases in activations during visually guided saccadic eye movements (Nelles et al.,  ). Older adults also showed increased activation in the pre-supplementary motor area and bilateral inferior frontal gyri (Zysset et al.,  ), as well as in the left PFC and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (Mathis et al.,  ), when matching incongruent vs. congruent stimuli. \n\nOverall, these findings suggest that age is associated with decreased and increased cerebral activations each during internally and externally driven processes. We tested this hypothesis by using a large functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set collected on the stop signal task (SST). In the SST, participants are required to respond to a go signal and withdraw their response when a stop signal appears. Because go trials are more frequent (∼75%) than stop trials (∼25%), the task sets up a prepotent response—pressing a button to the go signal. Thus, successful stopping in the stop trials requires constant monitoring of the stop signal. When participants are engaged in unmonitored responses—as when they are not watching out for the stop signal—in a trial when the stop signal does appear, they are more likely to fail in stopping than when they are monitoring for the stop signal. Thus, stop success (SS) involves greater allocation of attention and response inhibition than stop error (SE) trials (Li et al.,  ,  ; Chao et al.,  ; Duann et al.,  ). \n\nConversely, compared to SS trials, SE trials involve activities related to unmonitored responses and activities that are elicited by the error signals (Li et al.,  ). Similarly, compared to go success (GS), SE trials share activities of motor execution but involve additional odd-ball (infrequency of stop trials) and error-specific responses. Therefore, a contrast of SE > SS and SE > GS engages greater externally driven processes (Ide and Li,  , ; Zhang and Li,  ). In addition, as we showed previously, participants tend to slow down in their go trial responses with time during the SST. While participants maintained an adequate success rate (>95%) in go responses, the mean go reaction time (goRT) increased monotonically across sessions (Chao et al.,  ). This occurs presumably because of a gradual change of response strategy or shift to a more “conservative” mental set. Despite a general trend in slowing down during go responses, participants varied from trial to trial in their goRT. Thus, a go trial in which participants speed up, compared to all previous go trials, potentially represents a distinct scenario where they decide to deviate from the norm in go responses, risking that a stop signal is not imminent. We thus examined whether these go trials, in which they showed a decreased goRT (as compared to the mean goRT of all previous go trials), would actually involve specific regional brain activations, as compared to those go trials that showed an increased goRT (Li et al.,  ; Yan and Li,  ; Bednarski et al.,  ). Indeed, the results showed a distinct network of cortical and subcortical activations that have previously been implicated in risk taking (Li et al.,  ). Thus, a decision to speed up rather than to slow down after a go trial is internally driven, as participants risk for a no-show of the stop signal in that trial (Li et al.,  ). \n\nAltogether, we can specify four distinct contrasts, two of which each involved predominantly internally and externally driven processes, in the SST. The SST thus offered a unique opportunity to examine the hypothesis with a single behavioral task. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants and behavioral task \n  \nOne hundred and three healthy adults (51 females) with a mean age of 32.5 (SD = 12.4) years participated in the study (Table  ). Participants met the following criteria for recruitment: age 18 and older; right-handed and able to read and write English; no current or history of diagnosis of any Axis I psychiatric or substance (except nicotine) use disorders (First et al.,  ); no current use of psychotropic medications; no significant current medical including neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, hepatic, or thyroid disorders. Women who were pregnant or breast feeding were not recruited. Participants tested negative for cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, and benzodiazepines prior to fMRI. All participants signed a written consent after they were given a detailed explanation of the study in accordance with a protocol approved by the Yale Human Investigation Committee. \n  \n The number of subjects broken down by age and gender  . \n  \nAll participants performed a SST (Figure  ; Logan et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Chao et al.,  ; Hu and Li,  ). In the SST, two types of trials, “GO” and “STOP” were randomly presented with an inter-trial-interval (ITI) of 2 s (the time between the end of the previous trial and the start of the current trial). A fixation dot appeared on the screen to signal the beginning of each trial. The dot was replaced by a circle—the go signal—after a time interval, the “fore-period,” which varied from 1 to 5 s (with uniform distribution). The randomized fore-period minimized anticipation and allowed jittering of events of interest. Participants were instructed to press a button on a hand-held button box using the right index finger when they saw the circle. The circle disappeared at button press or after 1 s if the participant failed to respond. \n  \n Stop signal paradigm.   In GO trials (approximately 75%, Trial N), participants responded to the go signal (a circle); in STOP trials (approximately 25%, Trial N + 1), they had to withhold the response when they saw the stop signal (a cross). In both trials, the go signal appeared after a randomized time interval between 1 and 5 s (the fore-period or FP, uniform distribution) following the appearance of the fixation point. The stop signal followed the go signal by a time delay—the stop signal delay (SSD). The SSD was updated according to a staircase procedure, whereby it increased or decreased by 67 ms following a stop success (SS) or stop error (SE) trial, respectively. The inter-trial-interval (ITI) was 2 s. In this diagram, a GO trial was followed by a STOP trial to illustrate the two trial types and the ITI. \n  \nIn approximately one quarter of the trials, the circle was followed by a “cross”—the stop signal. Participants were instructed to withhold button press when they saw the stop signal. The trial terminated at button press or after 1 s if the participant successfully inhibited the response. The time between the go and stop signals, the stop signal delay (SSD), started at 200 ms and varied from one stop trial to the next according to a staircase procedure. If the participant successfully inhibited the response, the SSD increased by 67 ms in the next stop trial; if the participant failed in inhibiting the response, the SSD decreased by 67 ms. With the staircase procedure we anticipated that participants would succeed in withholding the response half of the time. \n\nParticipants were trained briefly on the task before imaging to ensure that they understood the task. They were instructed to quickly press the button when they saw the go signal while keeping in mind that a stop signal might come up in some trials. In the scanner, they completed four sessions of the task, each lasting 10 min, with approximately 100 trials in each session. \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nA critical SSD was computed for each participant that represented the time delay required for the participant to successfully withhold a response in half of the stop trials (Levitt,  ). SSDs across stop trials were grouped into runs (sequences of trials), with each run defined as a monotonically increasing or decreasing series. We derived a mid-run estimate by taking the middle SSD of every second run. The critical SSD was computed by taking the mean of all mid-run SSDs. It was reported that, except for experiments with a small number of trials (less than 30), the mid-run estimate was close to the maximum likelihood estimate of   X   (50% SS in the SST, Wetheril et al.,  ). The stop signal reaction time (SSRT) was then computed for each participant by subtracting the critical SSD from the median go trial reaction time (goRT) (Logan et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Imaging protocol \n  \nConventional T1-weighted spin-echo sagittal anatomical images were acquired for slice localization using a 3T scanner (Siemens Trio). Anatomical images of the functional slice locations were next obtained with spin-echo imaging in the axial plan parallel to the AC-PC line with TR = 300 ms, TE = 2.5 ms, bandwidth = 300 Hz/pixel, flip angle = 60°, field of view = 220 × 220 mm, matrix = 256 × 256, 32 slices with slice thickness = 4 mm and no gap. Functional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals were then acquired with a single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. Thirty-two axial slices parallel to the AC-PC line covering the whole brain were acquired with TR = 2000 ms, TE = 25 ms, bandwidth = 2004 Hz/pixel, flip angle = 85°, field of view = 220 × 220 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, 32 slices with slice thickness = 4 mm and no gap. Three hundred images were acquired in each run for a total of four runs. \n\n\n### Spatial pre-procsesing of brain images \n  \nData were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, UK). Images from the first five TRs at the beginning of each trial were discarded to enable the signal to achieve steady-state equilibrium between radio frequency pulsing and relaxation. Images of each participant were realigned (motion-corrected) and corrected for slice timing. A mean functional image volume was constructed for each participant for each run from the realigned image volumes. These mean images were co-registered with the high resolution structural image and then segmented for normalization to an MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) EPI template with affine registration followed by non-linear transformation (Friston et al.,  ; Ashburner and Friston,  ). Finally, images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm at Full Width at Half Maximum. \n\n\n### General linear model \n  \nThere were four possible trial outcomes: GS, go error (GE), SS, and SE. A statistical analytical design was constructed for each participant using the general linear model (GLM) with the onsets of the go signal from every trial convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the temporal derivative of the canonical HRF (Friston et al.,  ). For GS trials, the go signal onset was parametrically modulated by the reaction time and its temporal derivative; for SS and SE trials, the go signal onset was parametrically modulated by the SSD and its temporal derivative (Li et al.,  ). Realignment parameters in all six dimensions were also entered in the model. Serial autocorrelation of the time series was corrected by a first degree autoregressive or AR (1) model (Friston et al.,  ; Della-Maggiore et al.,  ). The data were high-pass filtered (1/128 Hz cutoff) to remove low-frequency signal drifts. The GLM estimated the component of variance that could be explained by each of the regressors. \n\nA contrast of SS > SE, SE > SS, and SE > GS was made from the first GLM for individual participants. Compared to SE, SS trials involved greater internally driven processes such as attentional monitoring and response inhibition. Compared to SS and GS trials, SE trials involved habitual, unmonitored response to the go signal and error feedbacks, respectively; thus both SE > SS and SE > GS involved externally driven processes. \n\nIn the second GLM, the GS trials were divided into those that are followed by a GS (pG), GE (pGE), SS (pSS), and SE (pSE) trial, with pG trials further divided into those that decreased in goRT (pGd) and increased in goRT (pGi), as compared to the mean of all previous GS trials (Li et al.,  ). We contrasted for individual participants pGd > pGi (post-go speeding > post-go slowing), a process that is internally driven and involves a decision to risk that an upcoming trial will not be a stop trial. \n\nAltogether, we thus had four contrasts, two of which (SS > SE and pGd > pGi) were predominately internally driven and the other two (SE > SS and SE > GS) externally driven. In group level analyzes, we ran a one-sample   t  -test to identify regions of interest (ROI) for each of the four contrasts. We then performed a multiple regression against age and gender for each of the four contrasts with small volume correction (SVC) for the ROIs. By regressing only voxels of the ROIs identified for each contrast, we ensured that the correlations with age reflect an association specific to the psychological construct of interest. For instance, a positive correlation of age with the contrast SS > SE would identify only voxels that showed greater activation during SS as compared to SE trials, reflecting attentional monitoring and response inhibition. Without restricting the regression to the ROIs, a positive correlation of age with SS > SE would also identify voxels that correlated negatively with age for SE > SS. \n\nWe used MarsBaR (Brett et al.,  ) to derive for each participant the effect size of activity change for the ROIs identified in each contrast for the regression with age. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral performance \n  \nTable   summarized behavioral performance on the SST. On average, participants made errors in about half of the stop trials, suggesting that their overall performance was adequately tracked by the staircase procedure. We correlated behavioral performance with age (Figure  ). Pearson's correlations showed that the median goRT, SSRT, and the GS rate were significantly correlated with age (Median goRT,   r   = 0.2606,   p   = 0.0078; SSRT,   r   = 0.3703,   p   = 0.0001; GS%,   r   = −0.3218,   p   = 0.0009), and the SS rate showed a trend toward significant correlation with age (SS%,   r   = 0.2046,   p   = 0.0382), corrected for multiple comparisons (  p   < 0.0083). The fore-period effect (  r   = −0.1067,   p   = 0.2833) and the post-error slowing (  r   = −0.0287,   p   = 0.7739) were not correlated with age. \n  \n Behavioral performance on the stop signal task (  n   = 103)  . \n  \nNote: goRT: go trial reaction time; SSRT: stop signal reaction time; GS%: percentage of go success trials in all go trials; SS%: percentage of stop success trials in all stop trials; FP: fore-period; PES: post-error slowing. Effect sizes rather than mean changes were computed for FP effect and PES to account for slight variation in the number of trials between participants. \n    \n Linear correlation between behavioral performance and age.   In each panel, each data point represents one participant and the line indicates the regression fit. \n  \n\n### The effects of age on regional brain activations \n  \nWe first examined the influence of gender by including both age and gender in the regressions. The results showed no regional activations associated with gender at   p   < 0.001 uncorrected. We, therefore, reported age-related activations by combining men and women. \n\nThe regressions showed age-related decreases and increases in activations for internally and externally driven processes, respectively (Table  . Figure   shows activations in each contrast overlaid on a T1 structural image using MRIcroN (Rorden and Brett,  ). In SS > SE, age was associated with decreased activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at   p   < 0.05, corrected for family wise errors (FWE) of multiple comparisons. In pGd > pGi, age was associated with decreased activations in the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) at   p  <0.05, corrected for FWE. For both contrasts, no brain regions showed age-associated increases in activation even when queried against larger masks derived with an uncorrected   p   < 0.05. \n  \n (A)   Age-correlated regional brain activations during internally driven processes.   (B)   Age-correlated regional brain activations during externally driven processes. \n  \nNote: Age_Pos: positive correlation with age; Age_Neg: negative correlation with age. OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; DLPFC: dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex; IFC: inferior frontal cortex; PMC: primary motor cortex; SMA: supplementary motor area; STG: superior temporal gyrus; IPL: inferior parietal lobule; G: gyrus. \n    \n Age-related changes in regional brain activations. (A)   Blue: age-related decreased activations in SS > SE;   (B)   Green: age-related decreased activations in pGd > pGi;   (C)   Red: age-related increased activations in SE > SS;   (D)   Magenta: age-related increased activations in SE > GS. Numbers at the bottom indicate the positions in the   z  -axis in the MNI coordinate. Neurological orientation: right = right. \n  \nIn SE > SS, age was associated with increased activation in bilateral primary motor cortices (PMC), postcentral gyri, supplementary motor area (SMA), bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), and the right IFC/insula. In SE > GS, age was associated with increased activation in bilateral PMC, the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the left IFC/insula. Likewise, for both SE > SS and SE > GS, no brain regions showed age-associated decreases in activation even when queried against larger masks derived with an uncorrected   p   < 0.05. \n\nWe extracted the effect sizes of activation for each contrast to correlate with age. The effect size of SS > SE correlates inversely with age in the left OFC (  r   = −0.3274,   p   = 0.0007) and DLPFC (  r   = −0.3094,   p   = 0.0015). Figure   highlights the correlation for the left OFC of SS > SE. The effect size of pGd > pGi also correlates inversely with age in the left IFC (  r   = −0.2216,   p   = 0.0327, Figure  ). Similarly, the effect sizes of all SE > SS regions (  r  MEAN = 0.3933,   p  MEAN = 0.0000) and SE > GS regions (  r  MEAN = 0.3602,   p  MEAN = 0.0001) correlate positively with age. Figure   highlights the correlation of the right PMC in SE > SS (  r   = 0.4240,   p   = 0.0000), and Figure   of the right IPL in SE > GS (  r   = 0.3665,   p   = 0.0001). \n  \n Linear correlation between effect sizes of regional brain activations and age.   Regional brain activations of internally driven processes (  A  : SS > SE; and   B  : pGd > pGi) were negatively correlated with age. Regional brain activations of externally driven processes (  C  : SE > SS; and   D  : SE > GS) were positively correlated with age. L: left; R: right: OFC: orbital frontal cortex; IFC: inferior frontal cortex; PMC: primary motor cortex; IPL: inferior parietal lobule. \n  \nTo take into account variation in behavioral performance, in a second analysis we included both age and SSRT as regressors. The patterns of age-related activations were very similar to those of the first analysis with age as the only regressor. In particular, SS > SE revealed age-related decreases in left OFC (  x   = −42,   y   = 41,   z   = −11,   Z   = 3.84,   p  = 0.006, cluster size = 16 voxels) and DLPFC (  x   = −27,   y   = 20,   z   = −46,   Z   = 3.60,   p  = 0.014, cluster size = 53 voxels) activation; pGd > pGi was associated with age-related decreases in left IFC (  x   = −45,   y   = 23,   z   = 19,   Z   = 2.96,   p  = 0.088, cluster size = 21 voxels) activation. SE > SS showed age-related increases in right PMC (  x   = 48,   y   = −7,   z   = 40,   Z   = 6.02,   p  = 0.000, cluster size = 163 voxels), left PMC/postcentral gyri/SMA (  x   = −54,   y   = −10,   z   = 46,   Z   = 5.81,   p  = 0.000, cluster size = 5847 voxels), right STG (  x   = 54,   y   = −13,   z   = 16,   Z   = 5.20,   p  = 0.001, cluster size = 49 voxels), and right IFC/insula (  x   = 57,   y   = 2,   z   = 13,   Z   = 4.51,   p  = 0.013, cluster size = 476 voxels) activation; SE > GS showed age-related increases in bilateral PMC (left:   x   = −48,   y   = −16,   z   = 43,   Z   = 5.41,   p  = 0.000, cluster size = 783 voxels; right:   x   = 42,   y   = −10,   z   = 40,   Z   = 5.31,   p  = 0.000, cluster size = 174 voxels), right IPL (  x   = 39,   y   = −55,   z   = 34,   Z   = 4.41,   p  = 0.019, cluster size = 1737 voxels), and left IFC/insula (  x   = −54,   y   = −46,   z   = 4,   Z   = 4.03,   p  = 0.080, cluster size = 1052 voxels) activation. \n\nTo further investigate the influence of performance on age-related activations, we compared 32 younger (27.3 ± 4.5 years) and 13 older (57.1 ± 6.0 years) adults matched in SSRT (young: 229 ± 13 ms; old: 238 ± 23 ms,   t   = 1.671,   p   = 0.102) for each of the four contrasts using two-sample   t   tests. The results showed that, when queried against a mask of SS > SE at   p   < 0.001, uncorrected, a cluster in the left OFC (  x   = −48,   y   = 41,   z   = −5,   Z   = 3.72,   p  = 0.024, cluster size = 73 voxels) showed less activation and no brain regions increased in activation in the older as compared to younger adults. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current findings support the hypothesis that age is associated with decreased and increased cerebral activations each during internally and externally driven processes. This unique pattern of age-related changes in regional brain activations is observed whether variation in behavioral performance is taken into account or not. \n\nBehaviorally, age is associated with increased goRT and SSRT, consistent with previous research (Bedard et al.,  ; Rush et al.,  ; Gamboz et al.,  ). While increased goRT may reflect declined speed in information processing (Park et al.,  ; Kray et al.,  ; Buckner,  ; Li et al.,  ; Hammerer et al.,  ) or a more conservative strategy (Reuter-Lorenz and Lustig,  ; Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell,  ), increased SSRT suggests age-related changes in cognitive functioning. A recent overview indicated that age-associated deficits in executive functions did not appear to go beyond the variance accounted for by speed-of-processing and working memory, except in aspects of cognitive control that required divided attention (Verhaeghen,  ). The SST demanded participants to attend to both the go and stop signals so that they could respond quickly and be able to withhold this response when the need arose. This dual requirement may thus elicit age-related changes in response inhibition, a function central to cognitive control. Altogether, these behavioral findings provide evidence validating the use of the SST in studying age-related changes in cerebral activations. \n\nActivations of the left OFC and DLPFC in SS as compared to SE trials, a contrast involving attentional and inhibitory control (Li et al.,  ), were inversely correlated with age. This finding is consistent with a recent study that also showed a negative correlation between age and prefrontal activations during inhibitory control in the SST, in a younger population (Cohen et al.,  ). Activations of the IFC during post-go speeding as compared to post-go slowing trials also were inversely correlated with age. Conversely, activations in many areas, including the bilateral IFC, PMC, postcentral gyri, and superior temporal gyri (STG), in SE as compared to SS or in SE as compared to GS trials were positively correlated with age. Further, no brain regions showed a positive correlation with age during SS > SE or post-go speeding > post-go slowing, or a negative correlation with age during SE > SS or SE > GS. These results support the hypothesis that age is related to decreased regional activations during internally driven processes and increased activations during externally driven processes. \n\nThis differential pattern of regional activations appears to be consistent with the top-down and bottom-up attention cortical circuits as proposed by Corbetta and Shulman ( ). These results are also in accord with the cortical networks of endogenous and exogenous control during saccadic eye movements. Specifically, Mort et al. ( ) reported predominantly frontal and parietal activations, respectively, each during voluntary (internally driven) and reflexive (externally driven) saccades. Thus, age-related decreases of activation in the dorsal frontal areas and increases of activation in the ventral frontal, temporal, and occipital visual cortices are consistent with this functional dichotomy of cortical systems. \n\nIn addition, these results are in line with the pattern of regional brain activations associated with dual mechanisms of control, as proposed by Braver and colleagues (Braver et al.,  ). Proactive control maintains goal-related information before target appearance and reactive control operates at a later stage for conflict detection and resolution. Using a continuous performance task, Braver et al. ( ) reported age-related decreases of sustained activity in the lateral PFC and increases of transient activity in the same prefrontal as well as posterior parietal regions. It was suggested that decreased and increased cortical activation reflect, respectively, inferiority of proactive control and greater reliance on reactive control in older adults (Paxton et al.,  ; Braver et al.,  ; Jimura and Braver,  ). \n\nIn an electrophysiological study of continuous performance task, Hammerer et al. ( ) reported a greater P3 response to cue than non-cue stimulus in younger adults but a greater P3 response to non-cue than cue stimulus in older adults. Their finding suggested that younger adults allocate attention to the more frequent cue stimuli while older adults are more attracted by the infrequent and unexpected stimuli. These results are consistent with our findings of age-related decreased activation in attentional regions during internally driven processes, and age-related increased activation in motor-sensory related areas during externally driven processes. \n\nMost behavioral tasks engage both internally and externally driven processes (Corbetta and Shulman,  ). For example, behavioral paradigms that are widely used to study cognitive control—Stroop, go/no-go, and flanker tasks—involve both intentional suppression of a prepotent response (internally driven) and processing of odd-ball effects (externally driven) during incongruent, as compared to congruent, trials. Thus, by comparing incongruent and congruent trials in the Stroop task, previous studies have reported age-related decreases in bilateral DLPFC (Milham et al.,  ) and left IFC (Langenecker et al.,  ) activations, as well as age-related increases in visual area activations (Milham et al.,  ). Similarly, in a go/no-go task, Nielson et al. ( ) observed age-related decreased activation of the right IFC and fusiform gyrus along with increased activation of the left DLPFC and IFC during “no-go” responses as compared to resting (see also Langenecker and Nielson,  ). In a flanker task, by comparing incongruent and congruent trials, Colcombe et al. ( ) reported age-related increases in activation of bilateral DLPFC, left IFC, and anterior cingulate cortex/SMA, as well as decreases in activation of the left MFG. Likewise, during verb generation, Persson et al. ( ) found age-related decreases in the left IFC and increases in right IFC activation. In recalling a six letter vs. one letter stimulus, which differed both in perceptual processing and memory load, older adults showed less activation in the right rostral PFC and IFC but greater activation in the right DLPFC (Rypma et al.,  ). Sometimes, the very same brain region increased in activation in one study but decreased in others for identical contrasts. For instance, in comparing incongruent with congruent trials, Milham et al. ( ) reported age-related decreases while Colcombe et al. ( ) reported increases in bilateral DLPFC activation. We speculate that this discrepancy reflected the different extents to which internally vs. externally driven processes were involved across studies. \n\nPast research attributed decreased cerebral activations along with impaired behavioral performance to aging of the brain, and posited compensatory mechanisms to account for age-related increases in regional brain activations (Park et al.,  ; Buckner,  ; Park and Reuter-Lorenz,  ). The Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) theorized that overactivation in older adults reflects a compensatory mechanism: as task difficulty increases, older adults fail to continue to increase activation (Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell,  ). In addition to task difficulty, the interpretation of compensatory mechanisms should take into account behavioral performance, as suggested by Nagel and colleagues (Nagel et al.,  ,  ). Using a working memory task with different levels of memory load, Nagel et al. reported different patterns of dose-response functions between high and low performers in young as well as in old adults. As memory load increased, young-high performers showed a positive linear increment of activation, and old-low performers showed a quadratic pattern of activation, while young-low performers and old-high performers showed a similar, mixed pattern. The fact that old-high performers presented a youth-like pattern suggested a compensatory mechanism, especially in low load conditions, consistent with the CRUNCH. On the other hand, compared to old-high performers, old-low performers did not sufficiently recruit task-related brain regions even in low load conditions, suggesting a cognitive/neurological impairment associated with age. Nagel and colleagues' research highlighted the impact of heterogeneous neural processes associated with aging on the interpretation of age-related differential patterns and emphasized the integration of imaging results and behavioral performance. \n\nWith the reminder from Nagel and colleagues' work, we regressed BOLD contrasts against age both with and without SSRT as a covariate and found that, when behavioral performance was accounted for, age was associated with similar patterns of cerebral activations. Moreover, compared to a group of younger adults who were matched in SSRT, older adults showed similar decreases in OFC activations during SS as compared to SE trials. In no case were increased activations observed in older as compared to younger adults. While these results support decreased cerebral activations during an internally driven process, they do not rule out the possibility of a compensatory mechanism in aging; older adults' performance may have reached ceiling and thus failed to demonstrate compensatory increases in activations (Park et al.,  ; Buckner,  ; Nagel et al.,  ,  ; Park and Reuter-Lorenz,  ). \n\nOn the other hand, the current results of increased activation during the externally driven process in SE > SS and SE > GS could reflect a compensatory mechanism in older adults, because post-error slowing, as an index of error processing, did not vary with age. However, we did not observe increased bilateral activation or reduction of hemispheric asymmetry in activation, in association with age (Cabeza,  ). The current results also did not show accompanying age-related decreases in activations of other brain regions (e.g., Grady et al.,  ) or age-related increases in activations of non-task areas, a dedifferentiation or over-recruitment, to compensate for performance (Park et al.,  ), even when the results were examined at   p   = 0.05 uncorrected. Taken together, evidence is mixed regarding the compatibility of the current results with compensatory processes in aging. \n\nA limitation in this study is the small number of participants in the highest age range. Only seven out of 103 people were over 60 years of age. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the pattern of age-related effects will follow the same trend for an elderly population. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study investigated how age influences regional brain activations in a SST. We observed age-related decreases in cerebral activations during internally driven processes and increases in activations during externally driven processes, in support of a functional dichotomy of age-related changes in cerebral activities during cognitive challenges. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"5cfb135feff7d757f35d01bc61b39335"}

Words are differentially represented in the brain according to their semantic category and these difficulties in ASC predict reduced activation to emotion-related words in limbic structures crucial for affective processing. Semantic theories view ‘emotion actions’ as critical for learning the semantic relationship between a word and the emotion it describes, such that emotion words typically activate the cortical motor systems involved in expressing emotion actions such as facial expressions. As ASC are also characterised by motor deficits and atypical brain structure and function in these regions, motor structures would also be expected to show reduced activation during emotion-semantic processing. Here we used event-related fMRI to compare passive processing of emotion words in comparison to abstract verbs and animal names in typically-developing controls and individuals with ASC. Relatively reduced brain activation in ASC for emotion words, but not matched control words, was found in motor areas and cingulate cortex specifically. The degree of activation evoked by emotion words in the motor system was also associated with the extent of autistic traits as revealed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient. We suggest that hypoactivation of motor and limbic regions for emotion word processing may underlie difficulties in processing emotional language in ASC. The role that sensorimotor systems and their connections might play in the affective and social-communication difficulties in ASC is discussed. \n   Highlights  \n  \nMotor and limbic cortices are typically activated by emotion words. \n  \nIn ASC, activity in these key regions is reduced for this word type specifically. \n  \nHypoactivity does not appear in brain regions unrelated to emotion word processing. \n  \nASC motor systems' hypoactivity to emotion words correlates with symptomatology. \n  \nMotor deficits may help explain emotion processing problems and other ASC symptoms. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInherent in Kanner's first description of autism as a ‘disturbance of affective contact’ ( ), the domain of emotion has been cardinal throughout the history of autism research. Disturbances in the affective domain may help to explain why individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficulty in connecting, socializing, communicating, and understanding the hidden mental world of others that drives much of social behaviour ( ). A recent, methodologically rigorous meta-analysis of the emotion recognition literature in autism suggests that a pervasive deficit exists ( ), extending to understanding emotions in vocal cues and nonverbal gestures ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). In terms of emotional expression, studies in autism also indicate lower responsivity to emotional displays of others ( ,  ), a lack of spontaneous mimicry of others' facial expressions ( ,  ,  ), and attenuated physiological response to emotional expressions, pain and distress in others ( ,  ,  ,  ). Vocalisations and facial expressions of affect in autism are characteristically flat or neutral ( ,  ,  ), and may be inappropriately disconnected from the social context in which they appear ( ,  ,  ). Finally, difficulty in identifying and describing emotions verbally, known as alexithymia, is much more prevalent in people with ASC ( ,  ) and their parents ( ). In summary, it seems that individuals with ASC are atypical in how they express emotions in comparison to typically-developing peers and that, likewise, their perception and mirroring of emotions are reduced, if not impaired. \n\nThis pattern of emotion expression and perception deficits is one component of the difficulty in mentalising, the ability to represent one's own emotional states and thought processes and those of others ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). In this sense, deficits in self-referential processing may alter an individual's ability to use the self as a proxy for simulating the mental lives of others. A deficit in representation and/or recognition of one's own emotions would impair attempts to accurately simulate others via oneself ( ). \n\nThe more generalized role of simulation in mental operations is increasingly recognised in the field of cognitive neuroscience, where   names it “a core form of computation in the brain” (pp. 618–619). A proposal which has recently gained speed with much empirical support is that self-performed actions (including those involved in emotional expression) and the perceptual consequences of the same lead to linked action–perception representations that are later used in cognitive processing and social interaction ( ,  ). In action cognition, for example, researchers have suggested that action goals are simulated in the motor systems of observers in order to understand the intentions underlying actions, such as whether or not the actor intends to eat the object ( ). In the context of the mirror neuron theory, these joint action–perception circuits, consisting of these self-same sensorimotor neurons with visual and/or auditory properties, have been found underactive in autism ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nGiven that alexithymia in autism is a   linguistic   deficit in processing the emotions of self and others, this implies that there is atypical processing of words semantically related to emotions. Prior work in autism suggests that these individuals do indeed show difficulty in understanding and using emotional and cognitive mental state terms (such as “dread”, “thought”: see  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) as well as an inability to link mental state terms to emotional information present in features of the eyes ( ,  ). The neural correlates of this deficit are, however, unknown. In the present study we used event-related fMRI to investigate brain systems activated when people with ASC process abstract emotion words. Our hypotheses about atypical cortical activity during emotion word processing focused on two key areas. \n\nIn typically developing (TD) individuals, understanding the meaning of action and emotion words and concepts seems to involve the cortical motor system ( ,  ). Our prior work has shown that individuals with autism show hypoactivity of cortical motor systems when they process action words and concepts ( ,  ), and this is consistent with atypical structure of the motor cortex ( ) and movement impairments in ASC (see  , for review). The motor regions unexpectedly inactive during action word processing in ASC were the same as those found particularly active when TD individuals processed abstract emotion words ( ). Theoretically, this ‘motor embodiment’ of emotion words suggests that the link between an emotion word and the emotional state it expresses depends on emotion expression in action ( ,  ,  ). In early language acquisition, emotion expression by infants provides a natural context for teaching emotion words and, therefore, the motor and limbic regions for emotion expression may be woven into the semantic representations of abstract emotion-related words. As TMS and work in brain-damaged patients shows that somatosensory and motor regions along with limbic emotion processing areas in insular cortex are necessary for the perception of emotion-related information immanent to the face ( ,  ), and these same areas are also active in emotion word processing ( ,  ), we hypothesised that these cortical motor and limbic systems would be affected in autism during emotion word processing and might reflect the degree of autistic traits in ASC. \n\nAn additional hypothesis focuses on limbic areas involved in emotion processing ( ). A range of these regions, including orbitofrontal and frontopolar cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and basal ganglia (putamen, caudate, and globus pallidum), are involved in emotion   word   processing (for review see  ,  ). Because these regions are specifically activated by   emotion-related   language, this subset of limbic areas, along with motor systems, provides a putative cortical basis for ‘simulation’ of word meaning and affective semantics more generally. It has been suggested that, at the neurobiological level, strong emotional-affective associations of emotion words are mechanistically organised as ‘limbic tails’ of cortical cell assemblies reaching into subcortical structures of the limbic system ( ). In addition to the aforementioned abnormalities of cortical motor systems, people with ASC also show atypical activity and structure in many of these limbic regions ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), so we predict additional hypo-activity in limbic systems when people with ASC process emotion-related words. \n\nIn summary, activation of motor and limbic areas during abstract emotion word processing seen in TD individuals may be atypical in ASC, partly due to their deficits in emotion processing and thus limbic activation, and to deficits in emotion expression in action and thus motor system activity. Whereas limbic hypoactivation might be predicted by the common emotion processing deficits in ASC, the additional prediction of motor hypoactivity in emotion word processing rests on the semantic link between emotion words and motor systems ( ). If the semantic link between an emotion and the word denoting it is via emotion expression in motor behaviour, the motor difficulties reported in ASC imply that this link will be atypical even during single word reading and comprehension, a task unrelated to overt emotion processing. Therefore, if words denoting abstract emotional states draw on cortical motor and limbic regions during processing, atypical functioning may be apparent in both of these regions when individuals with ASC simply read these words. In comparison with words denoting animals or abstract verbs, neither of which are especially linked with motor or limbic regions, we predicted that individuals with ASC would show a category-specific abnormality during emotion word processing that should be specific to the motor and limbic areas that are atypical in ASC and associated with emotion word processing in typical controls. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nRight-handed, native English-speaking participants comprising 18 high-functioning adults with an ASC (mean age: 30.4 years [standard deviation (SD): 10]; mean IQ: 113.5 [SD: 23]) and 18 age- and IQ-matched typically-developing (TD) controls (mean age: 28.6 years [SD: 11.7]; mean IQ: 110.2 [SD: 12.3]). Data from TD participants were previously published in  ; here, a new and independent analysis compares these participants and individuals with ASC who were recruited from the volunteer database at  , hosted by the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University, UK. All ASC participants had been previously clinically diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria: 17 met criteria for Asperger Syndrome, one for PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified). The ASC group scored significantly higher than the control group (t [32] = 6.857, p < .001) on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ: Baron-Cohen et al. 2001b), with a mean score of 34 (SD: 10) in comparison to the control mean AQ of 13 (SD: 5). All but 4 of the ASC group scored above 26 on this test, a cut-off point that captures the majority of adults with autism ( ). In order to keep the procedure short, this experiment matched participants only in full-scale IQ ( ). Although they were not directly matched in verbal IQ, both had performed with no significant differences in accuracy in a general language processing task reported in a previous experiment ( ) and the participants with ASC were high-functioning individuals who had or were currently working or studying, and so seemed to be comparable in their ability to read and understand the task. \n\nAll participants gave written informed consent prior to participating in this study and were remunerated for their time. Ethics approval was provided by NHS Research Ethics Service Cambridgeshire. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nA semantic rating study was carried out prior to the fMRI experiment in order to assess semantic properties for a large corpus of words: these included arousal, valence, imageability, concreteness, visual-relatedness, form-relatedness, colour-relatedness, and action-relatedness. Arousal and valence ratings have previously been employed in work on emotional-affective meaning ( ,  ) to classify words as emotional or non-emotional. Our previous work ( ) used an additional explicit rating of emotion-relatedness to identify words (primarily verbs) specifically used to speak about emotions, such as “dread”, “hate” and “fear”. As words with action-related meanings (e.g. “kick”) are also known to activate cortical motor systems, we excluded more concrete emotional items with sensorimotor associations used in the previous study (such as “wail” or “scream”), which were less optimal for exploring ‘pure’ abstract emotion concepts (see   for details of this and the rating procedure). As such, a more refined category of the most abstract emotion words (20) was contrasted with 40 animal names (nouns such as “hawk”, “mouse”, “sheep”) and 40 abstract verbs (e.g. “heal”, “dwell”, “waive”, which also lacked overt or concrete sensorimotor associations with the body). Words were matched in length, number of neighbours, word frequency, bigram and trigram frequency (see Table S1 in supplementary information for psycholinguistic and semantic properties of all experimental word categories). In order to disguise the focus of the study, the experimental words were dispersed among 240 filler words and 120 hash-mark strings (###) which, matched in length with the 360 word stimuli, were used as a low-level visual baseline unrelated to language. \n\nAnimal names were included as a word category unrelated to actions, in order to rule out the possibility of indiscriminate motor activity during general language processing. Whilst a lexical confound existed with the animal name category (nouns), both the emotion and abstract word categories were verbs (or had strong primary use as verbs): any atypical activity which appeared for emotion words but not for abstract verbs could not therefore be ascribed to a general problem with this lexical category. Though matched in word frequency, animal words were rated as significantly more familiar than our other experimental word categories. Abstract verbs, which were not significantly different to emotion words in familiarity (t [58] = .246, p = .807) or the concreteness of their meaning (t [58] = .510, p = .612), were the stronger control category. All three experimental word categories can be seen in Table S2 (Supplementary materials): they were presented in lowercase just as they appear. \n\n\n### Procedure and experimental design \n  \nPrior to scanning, all subjects completed Form A of the Cattell Culture Fair test ( ) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ:  ), in order to obtain measures of IQ and number of autistic traits. The Cattell Culture Fair test is a non-verbal IQ test frequently employed in cognitive neuroscience ( ). It is believed to provide the strongest measure of “fluid” intelligence ( ,  ,  ,  ), that which is distinct from learned verbal material (which influences some subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [ ]) and which is considered to reflect “true” problem-solving or abstract reasoning ability ( ,  ) rather than ‘crystallised’ intelligence (learned knowledge). \n\nEvent-related fMRI was used to compare brain activity during passive silent reading of experimental words, which were presented tachistoscopically for 150 ms. This short presentation time was employed to discourage saccades and encourage continuous attention in order to perform well on the task. Participants were asked to focus on a central fixation cross (presented for an average of 2350 ms) following the presentation of word stimuli, with SOA varied at an average of 2500 ms. Two pseudo-randomised stimulus lists were counterbalanced between subjects, who were instructed to read the words silently without moving their lips or tongue. Observation during scanning ruled out the effect of overt movements on results. \n\nImmediately following scanning, an unseen word recollection test containing a combination of experimental and novel distracter words asked participants to rate how confident they were that each word had appeared in the experimental task. Accurate results confirmed that participants had maintained attention on the experimental task. T-tests confirmed that both groups performed above chance (average hit rate: controls = 76.2% (SD = 18.1%), ASC = 76.2% (SD: 19.1%)), with no significant difference appearing between them in the number of correct answers (t [34] = − .018, p = .913). \n\n\n### Imaging analysis \n  \nParticipants were scanned in a 3 T Tim-Trio scanner with a 12-channel head-coil attached. Functional scans consisted of 32 slices covering the whole brain in descending order (slice thickness: 3 mm, in-plane resolution: 3 × 3 mm, inter-slice distance: 0.75 mm), and echo-planar sequence parameters were TR = 2000 ms TE = 30 ms and flip angle = 78°. SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) was employed for all processing stages, including slice-timing and re-aligning using sinc interpolation, co-registration of images to structural T1 images and normalisation of the previous to the 152 subject T1 template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). Transformation parameters were applied to co-registered EPI images, which were also resampled with a spatial resolution of 2 × 2 × 2 mm and spatially smoothed with an 8-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nSingle-subject, second level and group statistical contrasts were computed using the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF) of the general linear model. Low-frequency noise was removed by applying a high-pass filter of 128 s. Onset times for each stimulus were extracted from E-prime output files and integrated into a model for each block in which each stimulus category was modelled as a separate event. Group data were then analysed with a random-effects analysis. Direct statistical contrasts between groups for each word category were computed and voxel coordinates reported in MNI standard space. Statistical thresholding was initially set at a liberal threshold of p < .001, uncorrected, in order to observe the activation landscape evoked by words but was then followed up by more stringent thresholding at a Family-Wise Error (FWE) corrected level of p < .05. \n\nIn addition to whole-brain analysis, a regions-of-interest (ROI) investigation was undertaken, using the MarsBar function of SPM5, in order to look for statistical interactions between brain regions, word category and group in an ANOVA approach. ROIs were created by pooling participants from both groups and assessing regions where brain activity was robust for the general language contrast of all words against the hash-mark baseline. The three clusters (each with 3 peak loci) with most highly significant t values at a FWE-corrected threshold of p < .05 were selected for detailed analysis in 5 mm-radius ROIs. Activation was collapsed across the 3 peaks within each cluster to form the factor of Area for statistical analysis. These three Areas for analysis therefore included a left-hemispheric temporal cluster (its collapsed peaks located in inferior temporal [− 60, − 34, − 2] and fusiform gyrus [− 40, − 44, − 18, and − 42, − 4, − 44]: henceforth referred to as the “Temporal cluster”); a left-hemispheric cingulate cluster (collapsed loci in dorsal medial BA 6 [− 6, − 2, 64] and cingulate cortex at BA 32 [− 6, 16, 40] and BA 23 [− 8, − 8, 46]; henceforth the “Cingulate cluster”); and a right hemispheric motor cluster (its collapsed loci in primary motor [BA 4: 52, − 8, 42] and premotor cortex [BA 6: 62, 4, 12, and 60, 2, 38]; henceforth the “Motor cluster”). As can be seen in   Part A, the activity evoked by general reading spread across disparate areas, and consequently, a peak arose within the same cluster as the temporal ROIs that was actually located in left premotor cortex (BA 6: − 42, − 4, 44). As this peak could not be included in the Temporal cluster within the ANOVA described below, it was analysed separately. After analysing at these 3 Areas (collapsed across 3 ROIs in each), their homologues in the contralateral hemisphere were computed, and these homologues (themselves collapsed from individual peaks into Areas mirroring those in the left hemisphere) were averaged with the originals in order to carry out a bilateral analysis. \n\nFinally, correlations between AQ scores and activity in these three bilateral Areas for each of the three word categories (3 × 3 tests) were examined in the ASC group. On observing the data, two clear outliers were observed who scored very low in ASC traits, more than 10 points below the typical cut-off point of 26 ( ). The AQ is not a diagnostic measure but in this previous work, it reliably identified people with ASC in 83% of tested cases. It was noted that one of our outliers was in fact the one participant with PDD-NOS, which has also been known as “atypical autism”, being a diagnostic label for cases which meet many but not all the prototypical symptoms of autism or which have additional, uncharacteristic symptoms. These two individuals were more comparable with the control group for AQ scores (see Supplementary materials, image S4). These two participants were identified as outliers in the ASC group on two fronts, being more than 2 standard deviations from the group's mean AQ and secondly through calculation of the median absolute deviation (see  , for details of this recommended method for outlier identification). They were removed from the correlation analysis but kept in brain-imaging analyses for the sake of matching group size; checks were made to guarantee that removal of these outliers did not affect significance in the other findings. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nActivity during general word processing (all word categories against the hash-mark baseline), pooled across all participants, revealed widespread activity which was strongly left-lateralised across perisylvian language regions (fusiform to superior temporal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus), plus activity in the motor system bilaterally. \n\nDirect between-group statistical contrasts at a FWE-corrected whole-brain level revealed a range of cortical regions for each word category which were activated more strongly in the typically-developing (TD) control participants than in the ASC group. Regions where emotion words evoked greater activity in TD than ASC participants are displayed in   and   (p < 0.05, FWE corr.). These included a large cluster of voxels (n = 2438) encompassing left-hemispheric motor systems (BA 4 and 6) and the insula, and additional clusters in the left fusiform gyrus and the right-hemispheric motor system (BA 6). A left-hemispheric cluster including the anterior cingulate and caudate nucleus was also more strongly activated by emotion words in TD than ASC subjects, but this cluster did not survive FWE correction. Areas more strongly activated by the control word categories in the control participants are displayed in Supplementary Materials (Table S3), though none survived FWE correction. The contrast of ASC > control participants was non-significant at whole-brain level for each word category.   \nAreas of greater activity for emotion words in Control vs. ASC participants. \n      \nStatistical group contrast (controls > ASC) for emotion words (red). Activation is thresholded at p < .001, but the yellow parts of the activation clusters reflect activity which survived FWE (p < .05) correction. \n  \n\nIn a secondary ROI analysis, activation for each word category was examined in three large clusters of activity (left temporal, cingulate, and right motor cortex) that arose from the contrast of all words against the hash-mark baseline for all subjects pooled. The coordinates of the loci collapsed in each cluster can be seen in  , part A.   \nPart A): Activation for all words as contrasted against the hash-mark baseline, presented at a threshold of p < .001 for all subjects pooled. Individual loci, depicted above, were collapsed in the analysis to form one Temporal cluster, one Cingulate cluster and one Motor cluster. Part B): Graphs depict activity for each word category in each cluster. Significant Word Category × Group interactions, driven by between-group differences marked by asterisks (*), were found in the Cingulate and Motor clusters. Mean activation for the control participants is in blue, for the ASC participants in red. Error bars reflect standard error. \n  \n\nThese clusters were entered into an ANOVA including the factors Area (3 levels: Temporal, Cingulate, Motor), Word Category (3 levels: animal names, abstract verbs, and emotion words) and Group (2 levels). This revealed a significant (following Huynh–Feldt correction) interaction of Area, Word Category and Group:   F  (4, 136) = 4.833, p = .001. The left motor ROI, which arose as part of the cluster of activity with the Temporal ROIs but which was analysed separately, did not produce a significant main effect of Word Category (p = .09) or a Word Category interaction with Group (p = .866), though greatest activity for emotion words over other word types was seen in both groups. \n\nThe interaction of Area, Word Category and Group was unpacked in an analysis of each Area separately, employing an ANOVA with the factors Word Category (3 levels) and Group. Significant interactions between Word Category and Group were present only in Cingulate and Motor clusters (see  ,  ). Post-hoc t-tests of these interactions revealed significant between-group differences for emotion but not comparison word categories in both the Cingulate (  t  (34) = 2.116, p = .042) and Motor (  t  (34) = 2.867, p = .007) Areas. In fact, this hypoactivity for emotion words in the Cingulate Area correlated with the hypoactivity for emotion words seen in the Motor area (r = 863, p = .001), although no other correlations were seen between brain activity for word categories in other regions.   \nSignificant interactions in key regional clusters. \n    \n\nA bilateral analysis using homologues of the ROIs collapsed in these three clusters confirmed this pattern of hypoactivity, producing an interaction of Area, Word Category and Group which was significant following Huynh–Feldt correction (  F  (4, 136) = 3.993, p = .004). Again, post-hoc analysis revealed that emotion words were the only word category to differ significantly between groups in the bilateral Cingulate (  t  (34) = 2.145, p = .039) and Motor (  t  (34) = 2.826, p = .008) Areas. \n\nWithin group analysis of all three major clusters together showed no significant word category differences for ASC, but several in the control group (  F  [2, 34] = 3.444, ε = .906, p = .043). These were significant in the Motor Area (F [2, 34] = 8.049, ε = 1.000, p = .001), where greater activity was evoked by emotion words than by animal names (  t  (17) = 3.413, p = .003) or abstract verbs (  t  (17) = 3.002, p = .008) respectively. \n\nCorrelations between bilateral activity for each word category in the three key clusters and the AQ were explored in order to assess a potential behavioural link with the hypoactivity for emotion words described above. Following the removal of two outliers (see Methods for detail), a highly significant correlation between activity elicited by emotion words in the Motor Area bilaterally and AQ score (r = − .679, p = .004) was seen in the ASC group. This correlation reflected that higher scores, indicating a greater number of autistic traits, were associated with lower activity to emotion words in the Motor Areas (see Supplementary materials, item S4). It remained significant following Bonferroni correction (to a corrected p-value of 0.0056, based on 9 tests) and confirmation with a non-parametric test (Spearman's Rho: r = − .677, p = .004). We did not find any significant correlations between AQ scores and activity for any of the other categories in the motor Area, and no significant correlations between AQ scores and activity for any word category in the cingulate or temporal Areas. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nBrain activation elicited during passive reading of abstract emotion words and two comparison control categories was compared in ASC and typically-developing (TD) control participants. Whole-brain analyses of activity evoked by emotion words showed significantly reduced neurometabolic responses in ASC, specifically in bilateral motor areas and in the left insula and basal ganglia. ROI analysis confirmed and extended these findings. A statistically-significant interaction of the factors Area (3 levels: temporal, cingulate, motor), Word category (3) and group (2) revealed that in cingulate and motor areas (the former including BA 23, BA 32, the latter primary motor and premotor cortex [BA 4 and 6 respectively]), people with ASC showed significantly reduced activity than controls for emotion words, but not for abstract verbs and animal names. Reduced activity in the ASC group for emotion words did not appear in temporal cortex but only specifically in the motor and insular regions where the same TD controls showed the strongest emotion word-evoked activity ( ). Furthermore, motor systems activation in people with ASC significantly correlated with their number of autistic traits, as assessed by AQ scores. \n\n### Action binds words to emotional meaning \n  \nAlongside elevated rates of alexithymia ( ,  ) and general deficits in emotion processing and recognition ( ), people with ASC show difficulty in the processing of mental or emotional states and words semantically related to emotions ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). As these impairments must reflect a neurological correlate, we hypothesised that substantial differences might exist in how these individuals process and store words with emotional meaning. \n\nAgainst a background of extensive atypical limbic structure and function in ASC (see  ), reduced activity here for emotion-related words is not in itself a surprising finding. Due to the poor temporal resolution of fMRI, it is not possible to determine whether limbic hypo-activation to emotion words reflects general problems with late stage, conscious   post-understanding   processing of emotion words or a deactivation of these emotion concepts in the earliest time window when semantic differences are reflected by brain response ( ,  ). Reduced activity in the limbic system was however accompanied by and correlated with reduced activity in the motor system, which in turn reflected the degree of autistic traits in the ASC group. On the basis of this data, we would venture to suggest that the under-activation in limbic systems and its accompanying motor hypoactivity are a hallmark of autism rather than an epiphenomenon. \n\nCortical language and motor systems are tightly entwined, such that passive language perception activates motor regions in a general fashion, as if simulating the spoken or written language ( ,  ,  ). Over and above this, however, semantic theory and experimental data suggest that the meanings of both action words ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ; see  , for review)   and   emotion words ( ) are ‘embodied’ in cortical motor systems — such that words do not activate these areas equally. Action words are represented somatotopically such that they activate the cortical motor regions for the effectors involved in that action. For emotion words, the link between emotions and the symbols (words) denoting them may be established by way of actions, and motor activation in emotion word processing may therefore index this link. Cortical motor systems are the vehicle of emotion expression. Because they refer to abstract concepts such as “fear” which cannot be easily pointed to or labelled, the meaning of emotion words is established by the use of the words in action contexts — facial expressions and emotional behaviours such as crying, screaming and gesticulating. As the only visible ‘signals’ of internal emotional states, semantic theory postulates that these actions are critical for bridging the gap between word and meaning and so, in the typical population, become incorporated in the neural network representing the meaning of these emotion terms ( ). During this process, the word comes to be associated with the internal feeling it describes, and so, in addition, these words possess ‘limbic tails’ ( ), activating neurons in limbic structures involved in processing the specific emotions denoted by these words. In the typically-developing participants, these areas included the orbitofrontal and frontopolar cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and basal ganglia including putamen, caudate, and globus pallidum ( ; areas also highlighted in abstract word processing, see  ). In the motor system, these participants showed the greatest activity in motor systems for emotion words and the lowest for animal names with little or no semantic relationship to actions. Though abstract words, too, may be partially grounded in a multitude of sensorimotor action contexts ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), they are detached from   specific   action schemas ( ,  ). As such, despite equal ratings in action-relatedness, they evoked less activity in cortical motor systems than did emotion words, and the hierarchy of motor activation in our typical population – highest for emotion words, lowest for animal names as according with their action-relatedness – sits comfortably within the previous literature ( ). \n\nIn comparison to the typically-developing participants, individuals with ASC here exhibited reduced activity for emotion words in limbic and motor regions (primary motor and premotor cortex, the insula, cingulate and caudate nucleus: see  ). That reduced motor and limbic activity was restricted to emotion words, but not other word types, is evidence for the atypical alteration of the action-semantic link (via behaviours involving motor systems) between emotion words and their related emotions. Stringent matching of our word categories, particularly the abstract verbs, allowed us to refute the possibility that participants with ASC might have a particular difficulty with   all   verbs, or with all words of an abstract nature. The cause of the group difference in activity for emotion words can therefore be presumed to be related to the emotional and mental state content of emotion words (e.g. “dread”) that was absent in the case of equally abstract verbs such as “dwell”, revealing a genuine category-specific semantic abnormality. \n\n\n### The role of motor systems in emotion word processing, alexithymia and ASC \n  \nThe pattern of activity in the control group, who in a previous analysis showed substantial overlap in the motor activity evoked by abstract emotion words such as “fear” and that evoked by overt action words such as “frown”, is consistent with the theoretical grounding of emotional concepts via actions ( ). The precise role of such motor activity for emotional words, however, is as yet unclear. \n\nSemantic theory postulates that words are represented in distributed “action–perception circuits” which link the representation of phonology and articulatory word features in core perisylvian language cortices with the representation of meaning in sensorimotor systems ( ). Functional importance of these sensorimotor systems for the processing of action words is supported by a plethora of empirical work, which demonstrates a common neural substrate for movement and the understanding of action-related language ( ,  ). Among the strongest evidence is that relating deficits in action word processing to damage or disease of the motor system ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The bidirectional influence between motor systems and action-semantic processing is such that differences were observed in the same patients with Parkinson's disease before and after dopaminergic treatment ( ). Of the greatest relevance to the present dataset is our previous research, which demonstrated abnormalities and a deficit in action word processing in individuals with autism. A significant correlation was seen between hypoactivity for action words in motor cortex and slowness in a task of semantic processing: as activity in motor systems decreased in participants with ASC, reaction times for action word processing increased ( ). This was a very course-grained task, simply asking participants to categorise words as actions or objects, which may be why this impairment did not manifest in significantly greater errors. The fact that autistic participants were nonetheless significantly impeded in this very simple task suggests, however, that they might be substantially impaired in more complex or subtle action word processing tasks, as were the patients described above. The motor hypoactivity for action words that we had observed with fMRI was further corroborated with temporally precise combined EEG-MEG recording of autistic participants (Moseley et al., 2014). \n\nAs we did not conduct a behavioural test of emotion word processing, we cannot here show a relationship between the hypoactivity seen in motor and limbic regions and emotion word processing errors or impairment. We would hypothesise that, as for action words, this activation plays a functional role in their processing — and would accordingly predict autistic participants to show category-specific deficits for emotion words when these are compared with other well-matched word stimuli. Modulation of motor systems certainly affects processing of emotion-related language ( ), such that lesions or disorder of these areas would be expected to produce impairments. \n\nThough we did not conduct our own behavioural test of word processing, the motor and limbic hypoactivity seen specifically for emotion words in this analysis is consistent with other autism research reporting difficulties understanding and using emotion words, and with general emotion processing impairments. At the neural level, it is consistent with the atypical structural features in limbic regions and primary motor cortex in ASC ( ), and with movement impairments in autism ( ). In order to investigate a functional connection between motor and limbic systems activity and emotion word processing, and thus link the present data with reported impairments, future research should investigate the overlap of movement impairment and alexithymia in ASC and directly test the correlation between hypoactivity and category-specific deficits in active behavioural tasks involving processing words related to emotions. In such an investigation, it would also be optimal to measure alexithymia directly by means of a specialised scale. We attempted to retrospectively collect data using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20:  ) after our study finished, but unfortunately had few respondents from our sample, such that the hypothesised relationship between motor/limbic hypoactivity and alexithymia itself (as opposed to the autism measure included in this study) remains tentative. Interestingly, the present study observed a significant correlation, whilst reading emotion words, between hypoactivity in the motor system and hypoactivity in the cingulate cortex (though not with activity in other regions examined, ruling out any general hypoactivity). Although causal primacy of emotion expression deficits (associated with atypical motor circuits) over emotion processing/recognition deficits (associated with atypical limbic cortices) cannot be supported by this data, the correlation between motor and limbic hypoactivity observed here does imply a relationship between the capacity to express one's emotions and the capacity to process and understand the emotions of the self and others, as implied in the idea of the self as proxy for emotion processing ( ). \n\nExamination of ASC through the prism of movement disorder was considered by   but has been overshadowed by studies of the more prominent social-communication symptoms. More recently, however, atypical sensorimotor circuits have been argued to have wider implications for ASC, as they are suggested to contribute in a simulative manner to mentalising ( ) and other aspects of social cognition such as empathy ( ). Alexithymia is just one indication of impairments in self-referential processing ( ), and the idea that the self is used as a proxy suggests that this impairment may be associated with the broader meta-representational deficit in autism. If conceptual understanding of emotion concepts requires the involvement of motor systems then these broad impairments may be a downstream reflection of fundamental abnormalities in motor circuits. Other social-communication impairments in ASC might similarly arise from motor dysfunction, given the relationship between motor, social and language development in childhood ( ,  ) and the early emergence of motor abnormalities prior to other features of ASC ( ,  ,  ,  ). In ASC, correlations have been noted between movement difficulties and impaired social-communication skills ( ). In addition, motor impairment predicts childhood and adolescent speech fluency and delay in both children with autism and their high-risk siblings ( ,  ). In a previous publication, we demonstrated an association between motor hypoactivity and a category-specific impairment for action words ( ). This study also found a correlation between motor hypoactivity and AQ scores, a notable finding given that the AQ largely measures the social difficulties and narrow interests in ASC and makes no reference to motor symptoms which would be naturally expected to correlate with motor hypoactivity.   study fits with the perspective that brain circuits involving motor systems may underpin many higher cognitive processes. \n\nGiven this relationship between motor abnormality and ASC, the present work investigated the correlation between activity in motor areas evoked by emotion words and autistic traits. A highly significant correlation was seen between AQ scores in the ASC group and activity evoked by emotion words in the motor system bilaterally. This finding appeared following removal of two outliers, so further investigation with greater numbers is important to confirm this. It may be that impairment in emotion expression (dependent on the integrity of motor circuits controlling emotional behaviours) is a hallmark of autism and precedes and underlies the development of other symptoms, a perspective consistent with the aforementioned developmental primacy of motor symptoms of ASC. This suggestion requires further investigation in a non-correlational approach for statements of causal primacy to be justified. \n\nConsistent with the previous finding related to action word processing ( ), the current data demonstrates a relationship between autistic traits and motor system hypoactivity during processing of   another   word-type associated with motor systems ( ). As motor systems are typically involved in processing both action words and emotion words, the hypoactivity seen here is symptomatic of underlying abnormalities in motor circuits (and/or their connections) that correlate with ASC traits. It suggests a relationship between disorder of sensorimotor systems (and/or their connections) and the emotional-affective and socio-communicative difficulties seen in ASC. Further research is clearly necessary to elucidate a putative link between motor systems abnormality, emotion word processing deficits, and other socio-communicative symptoms of ASC. The role of motor systems in higher cognitive processes is increasingly recognised in neuroscience ( ,  ,  ,  ), and given the relationship between motor, cognitive and emotional processing, further study of motor impairments and their role in ASC may be timely and fruitful for interventions. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nUsing event-related fMRI, we explored the representation of emotion words in comparison to abstract verbs and animal names in the typical population and people with ASC. Our data revealed substantial differences between participant groups at a whole-brain level: the control group showed significantly greater activity for emotion words in motor cortex and limbic regions such as the cingulate and the basal ganglia, all of which have previously been implicated in emotion and emotion word processing. In addition, more thorough ROI analysis of temporal, cingulate and motor regions revealed a category-specific reduction for emotion words in the cingulate cortex and the motor system — both regions previously implicated in emotion word processing. This hypoactivation is consistent with ASC deficits in emotion expression and mentalising outside the language domain. We suggest this may constitute an underlying neural substrate for impairments in emotion word processing, which seems to rely on these motor and limbic cortical areas. We also report a significant correlation between motor hypoactivity in ASC and the expression of autistic traits. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by the   (MC_US_A060_0034, U1055.04.003.00001.01 to F.P., MC_US_A060_0043, MC-A060-5PQ90 to Y.

The aim of this study was to examine the connectivity between brain structures before and six months after following a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet and physical activity program in a group of sixteen obese women aged 46.31 ± 4.07 years. Before and after the intervention program, the body mass index (BMI) (kg/m ) was 38.15 ± 4.7 vs. 34.18 ± 4.5 (  p   < 0.02), and body weight (kg) was 98.5 ± 13.1 vs. 88.28 ± 12.2 (  p   < 0.03). All subjects underwent a pre- and post-intervention fMRI under fasting conditions. Functional connectivity was assessed using seed-based correlations. After the intervention, we found decreased connectivity between the left inferior parietal cortex and the right temporal cortex (  p   < 0.001), left posterior cingulate (  p   < 0.001), and right posterior cingulate (  p   < 0.03); decreased connectivity between the left superior frontal gyrus and the right temporal cortex (  p   < 0.01); decreased connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the somatosensory cortex (  p   < 0.025); and decreased connectivity between the left and right posterior cingulate (  p   < 0.04). Results were considered significant at a voxel-wise threshold of   p   ≤ 0.05, and a cluster-level family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons of   p   ≤ 0.05. In conclusion, functional connectivity between brain structures involved in the pathophysiology of obesity (the inferior parietal lobe, posterior cingulate, temporo-insular cortex, prefrontal cortex) may be modified by a weight loss program including a Mediterranean diet and physical exercise. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nStudies of the pathophysiology of obesity using advanced neuroimaging techniques such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) (at rest or using tasks), and positron emission tomography have found altered brain systems related to reward, motor, cognition, control, and attention [ , ]. Other studies have demonstrated that a Mediterranean diet has cognitive benefits [ ], suggesting that it may have a potential role in preventing overweight/obesity [ , ], though most of these were clinical studies with no neuroimaging analysis. Neuroimaging markers are sensitive measurements of structural and functional changes in the aging brain. We can use these markers to examine associations between diet- and age-related brain changes that might not be detectable using clinical assessment. A few studies have examined the relationship between a Mediterranean diet and structural neuroimaging markers of gray matter volume such as brain atrophy and cortical thickness [ , , , , , , ]. Luciano et al. found that lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with total brain atrophy over a three-year interval [ ], and Gu et al. demonstrated that Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with less brain atrophy, with larger brain volumes of the cingulate cortex, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampus, and larger cortical thickness of the superior-frontal region [ ]. Other studies found similar results, showing evidence that the Mediterranean diet predominantly protects the brain structure in certain cognitively-vulnerable regions (e.g., the frontotemporal lobes) [ , ]. In addition, the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and white matter structures has also been explored. Pelletier et al. found that Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with a general pattern of preserved white matter microstructure in multiple regions [ ]. Other studies have also shown the benefits of diet and physical activity on brain structure in successful dieters. Honea et al. found that weight loss percentage correlated positively with baseline gray matter volume in the right parahippocampal and orbitofrontal gyri in obese dieters, concluding that weight loss is related to volumetric changes in brain areas linked to interoception and food motivation [ ]. On the other hand, some studies have examined obesity and cerebral connectivity through functional magnetic resonance with a resting state modality, but very few included a dietary intervention and/or physical exercise. Furthermore, the impact of a Mediterranean diet on cerebral connectivity in obese patients when losing weight has not been previously explored. Thus, this study includes resting state and an intervention with a Mediterranean diet. Brain functional connectivity studies in the resting state in obesity are emerging, and have focused attention on brain networks such as the default mode network (DMN), the salience network (SN), and the somatosensory network (SMN) [ , , , , ] as being networks susceptible to alteration. \n\nThe DMN is a functionally-connected network of brain regions that includes the posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus/precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and inferior parietal cortices [ ]. Connectivity in the DMN is thought to reflect a baseline state of brain function, in which subjects are not focused on the external environment but rather on their internal mental state, which may include various forms of spontaneous cognition, self-reflective thought, or attention to internal stimuli [ ]. Previous resting-state studies have demonstrated potential differences in the DMN function between obese and lean subjects, with an increased DMN connectivity in obese individuals [ ]. In addition, exercise has been found to normalize DMN function in overweight/obese individuals [ ]. \n\nThe SN comprises paralimbic structures such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the orbital and insular cortices [ ], and is involved in emotional arousal, reward sensitivity, and decision-making [ ]. Functional connectivity in this network has also been found to be altered in obesity [ ]. Under resting-state screening, functional connectivity changes in the SN have been reported in obese as compared with lean individuals [ , ]. Increased connectivity in SN structures such as the nucleus accumbens and anterior cingulate has also been reported in obese women [ ]. Another study showed increased functional connectivity within the putamen nucleus in the SN in obese subjects [ ]. Finally, in response to visual food cues, chronic exercise has been associated with significantly reduced activation in the insula [ ]. \n\nThe SMN—including the supplementary motor area, sensorimotor cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex [ ]—has also been found to be altered in obesity [ , ]. In addition, associations have been found between these three networks (DMN, SN, and SMN) and fat mass and the obesity-associated gene Obesity Risk Allele during the resting-state [ ]. \n\nThe aim of this study was to examine the connectivity between structures included in the DMN, SN, and SMN before and six months after a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet and physical activity program in a group of obese women. Previous cross-sectional studies comparing obese with lean subjects have generally reported increased connectivity after studying these networks directly. Furthermore, in the present study we explored different structures included in these networks using seed-based analysis and examined the possible changes in connectivity between them before and after a weight loss program. We hypothesized that these obesity-related alterations in functional connectivity would be modified after the program, with obese subjects displaying decreased connectivity. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nThe study involved 19 obese women (defined by a body mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) ≥30 kg/m ) who agreed to participate in a program comprising a hypocaloric weight-loss Mediterranean diet and physical activity. Participants were included in the study on their first visit if they met the following inclusion criteria: having no metabolic disorder related to obesity, women between the ages of 35 and 55, had not tried to lose weight within one year of our intervention, and whose lifestyle was sedentary. Exclusion criteria included a history of any neurological disorder, an estimated intelligence quotient <85 points (assessed with the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd edition (WAIS-III)), or the presence of any psychiatric disorder (including eating disorders, anxiety or depression assessed with the Hamilton anxiety and depression scale, abuse of smoking, alcohol, or other drugs abuse), use of medication that could affect brain function (e.g., antidepressants), a history of any metabolic disorder possibly related to obesity, and general contraindications for MRI. Participants were recruited from the Endocrinology Department at the Regional University Hospital of Malaga, and the MRIs were performed at the Centro de Investigaciones Médico Sanitarias (CIMES), University of Malaga. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the revised Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Regional University Hospital of Malaga (approval code API5-10/13) on 29 October 2013, and all subjects provided written and signed informed consent before participation. \n\n\n### 2.2. Intervention \n  \nThe diet consisted of a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet [ , ] based on the use of olive oil as the main source of visible fat and a regular consumption of vegetables (≥2 servings/day), fruits (≥3 servings/day), legumes (≥3 servings/week), and fish (≥3 times per week), reducing the consumption of red meat (≤2 times per week), and eliminating (or reducing to ≤1 time/week) the consumption of dairy milk, sugary drinks, and sweets and chocolates. This hypocaloric Mediterranean diet restricted energy intake to about 600 kcal (or approximately 30% of the estimated energy requirement); 35–40% of the total daily calorie intake was from fat (8–10% saturated fatty acids), 40–45% carbohydrates (low glycemic index), and 20% protein based on the general patterns of the Mediterranean diet, calculating a calorie deficit following the Harris–Benedict equation, with the aim of achieving a body weight loss of ≥5%. \n\nParticipants were given healthy lifestyle guidelines by a nutritionist and were provided with a physical activity monitor. Regarding nutrition, participants made individual personalized visits with the nutritionist 30–60 min per week during the intervention, in which their body weight was measured and the response to weight loss was seen. In addition, they were given a validated semi-quantitative 137-item food frequency questionnaire [ , ] as well as a validated 14-item questionnaire [ ] to measure the adherence to the Mediterranean diet both at the beginning and six months after starting the intervention. High adherence was considered to be 12–14 points, moderate adherence 8–11 points, low adherence 5–7 points, and very low adherence 5 points. Furthermore, nutritional group meetings were held monthly to increase the motivation of all participants. Concerning the physical activity program, a daily exercise practice was recommended. The minimum aim was walking an average of 150 min per week. This minimum level of defined activity was based on the cardiometabolic benefit demonstrated in other studies [ ]. \n\nParticipants were assessed and encouraged to gradually increase their level of physical activity to reach at least 45 min per day at the end of the six-month intervention period. In addition, participants were given a pedometer for their own use to encourage motivation. Once a month during the intervention, they went to the sports center with the physical activity monitor who checked whether the participants performed the physical activity. \n\nBefore, during, and after the whole program, weekly anthropometric measurements (weight, body mass index, and waist circumference) were taken with a Tanita BC-420MA (Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and height was measured by a stadiometer with the participants wearing no shoes. Blood analysis measurements, including glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), were also recorded at baseline and after the program. \n\n\n### 2.3. Study Design \n  \nAll participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans under resting state conditions before and six months after following the Mediterranean diet and physical activity program. All the post-intervention fMRI scans were performed within 24–72 h after completing the intervention. They were asked to refrain from eating or drinking (except water) for five hours before the scan. All the MRI scans were performed at the same time in the afternoon. Functional connectivity of the regions of interest was assessed using a seed-based correlation approach. Three participants were not included in the analysis because they did not perform the second MRI (one did not complete the intervention and two did not want to be scanned again, although they completed the intervention). The rest of the participants (  n   = 16 women) responded to treatment and none gained weight. \n\n\n### 2.4. Image Acquisition \n  \nThe MRI scans were performed on a 3-T MRI scanner (Philips,Amsterdam,Netherlands, Medical Systems Netherlands, 3T Intera, Release 2.6, with an eight-channel platform) with a MASTER gradient system (nominal maximum gradient strength = 30 mT/m, maximum slew rate = 150 mT/m/ms), equipped with a six-channel Philips SENSE head coil. Head movements were minimized using head pads and a forehead strap. High-resolution T1 structural images of the whole brain were acquired using a matrix acquisition 312/320 r, field of view of 250 mm, Repetition Time (TR) = 9.9 ms, Echo Time (TE) = 4.5 ms, flip angle = 8°, Turbo field echo (TFE) factor = 179. Slice thickness was 0.8 mm and there was no gap between slices; voxels were isotropic: 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm. \n\nResting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) images were also acquired, with a Fast Field Echo (FFE)/ Echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with a 220 mm field of view (FOV), TR = 2000 ms, TE= 35 ms, flip angle 82°, an acquisition matrix of 80/128 r, and an acquisition voxel size of 2.75 mm × 2.75 mm × 4.00 mm. Three hundred volumes were obtained with 32 slices each, with no gap between the slices. The length of time of the resting state acquisition was 10:00 min. Both structural and rs-fMRI studies were acquired before and after the intervention. \n\n\n### 2.5. Image Processing \n  \nImage preprocessing was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, England;  ) running on MATLAB 8.2.0.701 (R2013b). Each subject’s functional images were realigned to the mean position of all scans, and it was checked that the participants’ movements during acquisition did not exceed 1.7 mm translation or 2.3° rotation. High-resolution structural T1 images were anterior and posterior commissures (AC-PC) oriented, and then the functional scans were co-registered to the respective T1 images. These were used for normalization to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Smoothing of the functional scans was carried out with an 8-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) kernel. The structural scans were also segmented in order to obtain grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) maps. \n\nThe conn toolbox (version 1.4, McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA,  ) was used for the seed-based connectivity analysis. A band-pass filter with cut-off frequencies of 0.008 and 0.09 Hz was applied to exclude drifts and high-frequency activations. In addition to movement parameters, white matter and CSF blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time-series were also introduced as confounders in the denoising stage in order to exclude non-neural fluctuations from the analysis. \n\nThe areas selected as seeds were structures included in the well-established neural networks (DMN, SN, and SSN) including: left and right inferior parietal lobes, right and left superior temporal gyrus, left and right insula, right and left superior frontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, right and left posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus, and right and left olfactory regions. Bilateral olfactory and posterior cingulum regions were taken from the IBASPM116 atlas included in the Wake Forest University Pickatlas toolbox [ ]. The other areas were taken from the resting state reliability (rsREL) regions of interest (ROIs) provided with the conn toolbox. They are defined as 9-mm radius spheres, centered on the coordinates (seed definitions). \n\nFollowing the usual pipeline for seed-based correlation analyses, a first-level individual analysis was initially carried out, followed by a second-level group analysis. Firstly, an ROI-to-ROI approach was used: the BOLD signal timeline at each seed region was checked for correlations with the BOLD signal timeline at each of the other preselected regions. Afterwards, a seed-to-voxel analysis was also carried out: the correlation between the BOLD timeline at the seed region and the BOLD timeline at each voxel of the image was calculated. As mentioned, these correlations were initially studied on an individual level, and then the second level of analysis was applied. Here, the parametric (  z  -score) values obtained for each individual were compared, both at the ROI-to-ROI and at the seed-to-voxel levels. In particular, a paired   t  -test allowed assessment of changes in BOLD signal correlation associated to the program for each seed. \n\nFor ROI-to-ROI analyses, two-sided family-wise error (FWE) correction was applied at the analysis level, with a significance threshold of   p   = 0.05. Seed-to-voxel comparisons were FWE-corrected and false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected at the cluster level, with the same threshold as before (  p   = 0.05). \n\n\n### 2.6. Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll the clinical and blood test parameters are summarized as descriptive statistics in  . The results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. For inter-group comparisons before and after the intensive weight loss program, paired-sample   t  -tests were used for continuous variables, and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for such variables when the assumptions for the   t  -test were violated. The α-level was set at   p   < 0.05 for these two-tailed statistical comparisons using SPSS statistical software, version 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics \n  \nThe participants were 16 obese women aged 46.31 ± 4.07 years. Before and after the Mediterranean diet and physical activity program, the BMI (kg/m ) was 38.15 ± 4.7 vs. 34.18 ± 4.5 (  p   < 0.02), and the weight (kg) was 98.5 ± 13.1 vs. 88.28 ± 12.2 (  p   < 0.03). The score for adherence to the Mediterranean diet rose from 7.2 ± 2.3 points at baseline to 10.7 ± 2.0 points after the program. All the clinical, anthropometric, and blood analysis characteristics at baseline and after the weight loss program are summarized in  , and changes in energy and nutrient intakes according to weight loss baseline and after the intervention are summarized in  . \n\n\n### 3.2. Neuroimaging Connectivity \n  \n#### 3.2.1. Functional Connectivity of the Left Inferior Parietal Lobe \n  \nIn the ROI-to-ROI analysis, the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) showed lower connectivity with the precuneus and the right inferior parietal lobe after the Mediterranean diet and weight loss program than before (two-sided FWE-correction at the analysis level,   p   < 0.05). In the seed-to-voxel examination, the IPL showed decreased functional connectivity with three clusters after the program. The first cluster included the right angular gyrus (AG), the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), the right supramarginal gyrus (SmG), and the insular cortex (IC) (  p   < 0.001); the second cluster included the right dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dpCC) and the left and right somatosensory association cortices (SsAC) (  p   < 0.001); and the third cluster included the left dpCC, the left SsAC, the left retrosplenial cingulate cortex (RsCC), and the left cingulate cortex (CC) (  p   < 0.03). Data were thresholded at a cluster-extent threshold of   p   ≤ 0.05, both with few corrections and for FDR correction ( ). The results are summarized in  . \n\n\n#### 3.2.2. Functional Connectivity of the Left Superior Frontal Gyrus \n  \nThe seed-to-voxel analysis showed that after the intervention the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) region had lower functional connectivity with the right SmG, right STG, right IC, and right AG (  p   ≤ 0.05, FWE-corrected) ( ). The results are summarized in  . \n\n\n#### 3.2.3. Functional Connectivity of the Right Posterior Superior Temporal Gyrus \n  \nThe results of seed-to-voxel analysis showed that after the intervention the right posterior STG region had lower functional connectivity with the left premotor cortex (PmC), left primary motor cortex (PMC), and the left primary somatosensory cortex (PSsC) (  p   < 0.02, FWE-corrected) ( ). The results are summarized in  . \n\n\n#### 3.2.4. Functional Connectivity of the Right Posterior Cingulate Cortex \n  \nIn the ROI-to-ROI analysis, the right posterior CC region showed decreased connectivity with the left posterior CC after the program. \n\nThe seed-to-voxel analysis also showed that the right posterior CC had lower functional connectivity with the left dpCC and left ventral posterior cingulate cortex (vpCC) (  p   < 0.04, FWE-corrected) ( ). The results are summarized in  . \n\nWe found no statistically significant differences when using the following seed regions: right inferior parietal lobe, right superior frontal cortex, left superior temporal gyrus, left insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, and right and left olfactory regions. \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThe present study was performed to examine the cerebral functional connectivity in obese women screened before and six months following a program involving a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet and increased physical activity. Previous studies have studied the effect of a Mediterranean diet on cognition and brain structure [ , ]. However, the impact of this intervention program (Mediterranean diet and physical activity) on cerebral connectivity in obese women after weight loss has not been previously studied. After the intervention, the anthropometric variables (BMI and weight) were reduced significantly in all patients, and the blood analysis profile (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, insulin resistance index, insulin, and glucose) improved greatly. \n\nThe main finding of this study was the identification of decreased connectivity within the inferior parietal cortices, the posterior cingulate, and the prefrontal cortex after the Mediterranean diet and physical activity program (structures included in the DMN). In addition, there was also decreased connectivity within the temporo-insular cortex (included in the SN), as well as decreased connectivity in the somatosensory cortex (included in the SMN) after the intervention program. \n\nPrevious studies using functional connectivity analysis of the so-called “default mode network”—a network comprising the lateral parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus [ , ]—have demonstrated increased DMN connectivity in overweight/obese individuals, indicating an increased focus on internal states such as appetite or food-related cognitive factors [ , ]. A previous study performed in a eucaloric state found greater connectivity in obese compared to lean individuals in the lateral inferior parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. In addition, the authors found that the lateral parietal connectivity correlated positively with appetite [ ]. Thus, greater connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex has been postulated to contribute to overeating, reflecting an imbalance between cognitive and emotional processing of food cues [ ]. In line with previous studies, our results showed decreased connectivity in the left inferior parietal cortex with the posterior cingulate cortices after the intervention program, showing that the connectivity between these structures was modified after the program. As mentioned before, the lateral inferior parietal and posterior cingulates are nodes of the DMN and are involved in coordinating the subsystems of self-referential thought and internal state, such as appetite or other processing of gut signals or food-related cognitive factors [ , ]. Given this fact, it is possible to speculate on the functional significance of over-connectivity of these regions in obese individuals during fasting state [ ] and, interestingly, according to our results, this over-connectivity can be rectified by weight loss and physical activity. \n\nOn the other hand, we also found decreased connectivity between the lateral inferior parietal cortex and the temporal cortex, including the insula. The insula is part of the so-called “salience network” which is involved in consciousness and self-perception and connects the perception of internal stimuli to aspects of emotion and motivation [ ]. The SN, including the anterior cingulate, limbic structures, and temporal cortex, has been related to obesity in that it perceives internal and external cues to appropriately adapt behavior and/or physiology accordingly [ , ]. Thus, the insular cortex plays an established role in cognitive and emotional control and has been suggested to induce the termination of feeding and the ability to predict the satisfactory effects of food intake [ , ]. Increased SN functional connectivity in overweight/obese individuals has also been previously reported [ , ] under resting state conditions. In line with our results, decreased connectivity between the lateral inferior parietal cortex and the temporo-insular cortex after the weight loss program suggest that this decreased connectivity probably plays an inhibiting role in emotional functions susceptible to modification by a weight loss program. \n\nWe also found decreased connectivity after the Mediterranean diet and physical intervention program between the prefrontal cortex and the insular/angular gyrus/superior temporal gyrus/supramarginal gyrus. The prefrontal cortex is involved in the central orexigenic network [ ], and its connections with the insula reflect an ability to “evaluate” the perception of hunger during fasting state in lean subjects. A “satiation” of this signal is understood to occur after food intake, whereas in obesity there seems to exist a level of insensitivity to these food-related cues [ , ]. According to our results, changes in the connections between the prefrontal and insular cortices are probably implicated in feeding initiative and decrease during weight loss, showing that these regions are also susceptible to modification. \n\nFurthermore, we found decreased connectivity in the temporal cortex with the left premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices after the Mediterranean diet and physical activity intervention program. The SMN—including the supplementary motor area, sensorimotor cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex [ ]—corresponds to the action–execution programs and perception–somesthesis integration [ ]. Previous studies have reported evidence for differences in somatosensory processing in obese subjects [ ]. Conversely, a recent study in women with anorexia nervosa found decreased connectivity in the SMN when compared with controls, suggesting that it could be related to altered interoception and body image in these women when they are underweight [ ]. Our results suggest that changes in sensory-motor structures would be modified after a weight loss program, as these structures play an important role in self-perception and the somesthesis mechanism. \n\nFinally, we found decreased connectivity after the intervention between the right posterior cingulate cortex and the left posterior cingulate cortex, which suggests the integration between both hemispheres [ ]. \n\nA few studies have examined the effects of different interventions on functional connectivity in individuals with obesity. McFadden et al. found a six-month exercise intervention to be associated with reduced DMN connectivity in the precuneus during rest. Interestingly, the authors concluded that, given previous reports of DMN overconnectivity in overweight/obese individuals, the findings may indicate an exercise-related “normalization” of network function [ ]. Recently, Legget et al. found changes in connectivity after a six-month exercise program in the posterior cingulate cortex and other networks (language, visual, sensorimotor, executive, basal ganglia, and posterior DMN), which were significantly reduced [ ]. Other authors have found evidence of changes in functional connectivity depending on intervention type (diet vs. bariatric surgery) after weight loss [ ]. \n\nThe effects of weight loss on the brain are still unknown. It is difficult to speculate which biological changes are associated with the differences observed during our study in functional brain connectivity after the Mediterranean diet and physical activity program. Exercise has been suggested to promote neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity [ , , , ]. Exercise may affect metabolic factors and neuronal circuitry and exert positive effects on neuronal networks by reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines, increasing the production of neurotrophic factors, or increasing neurotransmitter levels [ , , , ]. In addition, weight loss also influences adipocytokines, inducing lower levels of leptin and higher levels of adiponectin. Adiponectin—levels of which are inversely correlated with adiposity—improves insulin sensitivity in major insulin target tissues, modulates inflammatory responses, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism. Previous studies have suggested neuroprotective effects of adiponectin in the hippocampal cells in the temporal lobe [ , ]. The burden of the insula and the precuneus has also been associated with low levels of adiponectin [ ], and both these areas are important structures of the main brain networks (DMN and SN). \n\nThe present study is the first to study resting-state functional connectivity in obesity while including both a Mediterranean diet and physical activity intervention. Several limitations of the current study need to be addressed. First, the sample size is small, which is a potential limitation. Another important limitation is that there was no control group to safely attribute changes, though the results and the longitudinal design are strengths. In addition, it is not possible to know whether the changes are due to physical exercise, the Mediterranean diet reducing caloric intake, or both. In general, patients carrying out a weight loss program at the Department of Endocrinology are advised to follow a diet (reducing caloric intake) as well as engaging in physical exercise. Further longitudinal studies including only physical exercise [ ] would be desirable to determine which is responsible for the connectivity changes—the Mediterranean diet, the physical activity, or both. Moreover, only female subjects were included. We decided to include only female subjects to avoid a sex bias. As a consequence, our results can only be generalized to women. Finally, other technical limitations (e.g., using a six-channel head coil rather than the more standard 12-channel head coil which would have reduced the noise ratio) could influence the findings. Furthermore, all the functional MRIs (pre- and post-intervention) were carried out under fasting conditions, and it would be interesting to evaluate brain connectivity in a state of satiety; it is probable that the brain networks found would differ since previous evidence shows that the pathophysiology is different [ , ]. Despite the aforementioned limitations, we still consider our results to be clinically pertinent, as they support the benefits of the Mediterranean diet and may provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity. However, more longitudinal studies on larger samples, with an appropriate design including a control group, are needed to shed light on the effects of obesity on the brain and to aid in developing future treatments that could act on the neural networks involved in this disease. \n\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that functional connectivity between specific brain structures involved in obesity physiopathology (the inferior parietal lobe, posterior cingulate, temporo-insular cortex, and prefrontal cortex) might be modified by a weight loss program including a Mediterranean diet and physical exercise. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"f03f7a2f676e5cacc9776e068f8f957b"}

Over a period of four weeks (six treatments), we collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans from 30 patients before their first, third and sixth treatments. Clinical outcome showed a significantly greater Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain score (improvement) with verum acupuncture compared to the sham acupuncture. Longitudinal cortical thickness analysis showed that the cortical thickness at left posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pMPFC) decreased significantly in the sham group across treatment sessions as compared with verum group. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis using the left pMPFC as a seed showed that after longitudinal treatments, the rsFC between the left pMPFC and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), medial frontal pole (mFP) and periaquiduct grey (PAG) are significantly greater in the verum acupuncture group as compared with the sham group. Our results suggest that acupuncture may achieve its therapeutic effect on knee OA pain by preventing cortical thinning and decreases in functional connectivity in major pain related areas, therefore modulating pain in the descending pain modulatory pathway. \n \n\n# Body\n \nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health problem among the elderly and is associated with considerable disability . The knee is one of the most common body locations for OA. A recent analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) indicated that about 35% of women and men aged 60 years and above had radiographic knee OA . \n\nOA is a complex chronic pain condition due in part to both nociceptive and neuropathic mechanisms . Previous studies have demonstrated central sensitization in osteoarthritis patients , increased activity in the periaqueductal grey (PAG) matter associated with stimulation of the skin in referred pain areas of patients , and increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in pain related brain regions including the primary and secondary somatosensory, insula, cingulate cortices, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and PAG , indicating pathology of the central nervous system in knee OA patients. \n\nDespite the high prevalence rate of OA, the treatment of OA is far from satisfactory . Pharmacological treatment of knee OA is often ineffective with unwanted and dangerous side effects . Acupuncture is a component of the “Traditional Chinese Medicine” (TCM) system. Multiple randomized clinical trials have suggested that knee OA patients can benefit from acupuncture treatment . However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture treatment in knee OA patients are still poorly understood. \n\nAs a unique treatment modality, studies have shown that acupuncture may produce an analgesic effect through the endogenous descending pain modulatory system . Brain imaging studies have also shown that acupuncture needle stimulation  can evoke widespread brain activity changes and modulate the functional connectivity (FC) of the pain processing network , which opens a new window to understand the central mechanism of acupuncture treatment. \n\nIn parallel, investigators have found abnormal brain structures  or disrupted FC  in patients with various chronic pain disorders. \n\nMore recently, accumulating evidence suggest that the disrupted brain structure and functional connectivity can be reversed after successful treatment. For instance, Seminowicz and colleagues  found that cLBP is associated with decreased cortical thickness and abnormal activity during attention-demanding tasks in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Most intriguingly, after successful treatment of back pain, both cortical thickness and functional connectivity (FC) of the DLPFC were normalized. In another study, the investigators  found that gray matter volume decreases within the left thalamus in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip; these thalamic volume changes reverse after hip arthroplasty and are associated with decreased pain and increased function. \n\nIn the present study, we investigated changes in cortical thickness and functional connectivity in knee OA patients across longitudinal acupuncture treatments. All patients were randomized to receive either verum or sham acupuncture. Using a longitudinal treatment design , each patient received 6 acupuncture treatments over 4 weeks. We collected brain structure and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans during the first, third and sixth treatments ( ). We also administered the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)  before and after the six-session acupuncture treatment period. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThe Institutional Review Board at Massachusetts General Hospital approved all study procedures. The experiment was performed in accordance with approved guidelines. All subjects who enrolled in this study provided written informed consent before beginning any study procedure. We debriefed all subjects at the end of the study. \n\n\n### Patient recruitment and inclusion criteria \n  \nWe recruited acupuncture naïve patients aged 40–70 with a diagnosis of chronic osteoarthritis (OA) in the right and/or left knee from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and the greater Boston area. \n\nSubjects exhibiting Grade 2 or Grade 3 OA as defined by the Kellgren-Lawrence Scale used for radiographically grading knee OA were included in the study. We excluded subjects who: 1) had undergone any interventional procedures for knee pain within 6 months prior to enrolling in the study, 2) intended to undergo surgery during the time of involvement in the study, 3) experienced knee pain due to causes other than OA, such as inflammation or malignancy, 4) had received a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or other leg-related pain disorders, 5) were taking opioids, benzodiazepines, or other medications that may influence brain imaging outcomes, or 6) presented MRI contraindications. All enrolled OA patients had an endogenous average pain intensity rating of >2 on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scale at the first visit. \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nAll subjects, regardless of the presence of bilateral or unilateral pain, received treatment on the knee that presented them with the most severe pain. We stratified subjects by knee and randomized them into one of three groups: high dose real acupuncture (6 acupoints), low dose real acupuncture (2 acupoints), or high dose sham acupuncture (6 non-acupoints with Streitberger placebo needles) ( ). Subjects were randomized using a block design generated by a biostatistician blind to the treatment mode. Only the acupuncturist was not blinded. This study was designed to investigate whether the number of needles (acu points) influences the treatment effect. Therefore, we included two groups receiving real acupuncture treatments with different numbers of acu points, but identical stimulation paradigm. \n\nAfter an initial screening session, each subject engaged in a total of 6 acupuncture treatment sessions in one month (twice per week for the first two weeks, once per week for the last two weeks). Treatments 1, 3 and 6 occurred during a scan session with the patient lying in a 3-Tesla MRI scanner while we acquired fMRI data. All other treatments occurred in our behavioral testing room. \n\n\n### Acupuncture administration \n  \nEach acupuncture treatment session lasted about 25 minutes for subjects in both the verum and sham acupuncture groups. The two acupoints selected for the low dose acupuncture group (ST35 and Xi yan (extra point)) were located near the knee. Each acupoint was stimulated a total of twelve times. The high dose acupuncture group received treatment at four additional acupoints (GB34, SP9, GB39 and SP6) (see  ) and each acupoint was stimulated 4 times. The locations of all acupoints were based on the text book of Chinese Acupuncture . All these points are well documented for the treatment of knee pain . \n\nFor subjects receiving sham acupuncture, the acupuncturist applied placebo needles  at six non-acupoints using a paradigm identical to that of the high dose verum needle administration. Rather than penetrating the skin as a verum needle does, the sham needle retracts up the handle shaft when the acupuncturist presses it against the skin. Sham point 1 was located 1.5 cun posterior and inferior to GB4, sham points 2–3 were located 1.5 cun and 3 cun inferior to sham point 1, sham point 4 was located 1 cun posterior to the midpoint of K9 and K10, and sham 5–6 were located 1.5 cun inferior and superior to the sham point 4 respectively. All sham points were located on the lower leg where no meridians pass ( ). \n\nFor all treatments, the acupuncturist placed a small plastic ring over the point and secured the ring with a thin strip of sterile plastic tape ensuring patient blindness to the actual site of needle insertion and thus blindness to whether the treatment was verum or sham. During acupuncture, the acupuncturist stimulated one point at a time in a predetermined order, each for 10 seconds with 30-second breaks between each acupoint. ( ). The total treatment and stimulation time for all three groups was the same. We randomized the specific starting acupoint across patients, but held it constant throughout all sessions for each individual patient. For consistency, we kept leg position, acupoint location, and needling parameters (1–2 cm depth for all points, all needles were evenly rotated approximately 120 rotations per minute, we also attempted to produce moderate deqi sensations on a 0–10 scale) constant across groups. In the fMRI sessions, the treatment spanned two 9-minute acupuncture/fMRI scans followed by Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) rating. \n\nAs a treatment quality control, we measured the deqi sensation evoked by two separate acupuncture stimulation periods, one midway through the treatment and one at the end of the treatment, using the MASS . \n\n\n### Clinical outcomes \n  \nWe measured clinical outcomes using the KOOS , which is comprised of 5 subscales: 1) pain, 2) other symptoms, 3) function in daily living (ADL), 4) function in sport and recreation, and 5) knee-related quality of life (QOL). Each subscale allows for calculation of a normalized score, with 0 denoting the most extreme symptoms/pain and 100 denoting no symptoms/pain . Based on previous studies , we selected the KOOS pain subscale and function in daily living subscale as our primary outcome measures. We used all other subscale measurements as secondary outcomes. Trained research assistants, blinded to treatment mode, administered the KOOS to all patients at baseline (up to one week prior to the first treatment) and again after the final treatment. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nEach subject participated in three identical fMRI scanning sessions. Scan 1 (treatment 1) and scan 2 (treatment 3) were separated by approximately 7 days; scan 2 and scan 3 (treatment 6) were separated by approximately 18 days. We used a 3-axis gradient head coil in a 3-Tesla Siemens MRI system equipped for echo planar imaging (EPI). Each fMRI session included an anisotropic magnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) structural sequence followed by a 6-minute resting state fMRI. The MPRAGE scanning parameters included TR of 2200 ms, echo time of 9.8 ms, flip angle of 7, field-of-view of 230 mm , slice thickness of 1.2 mm. For the resting state, the scan acquisition included 47 slices with a thickness of 3 mm, a TR of 3000 ms, a TE of 30 ms, flip angle of 85 degrees, field of view of 216 mm  and a 3 × 3-mm in-plane spatial resolution. Following the first resting state fMRI, we conducted two functional scans during the 25-minute acupuncture administration and a second resting state scan following acupuncture administration ( ). \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Brain structure analysis using FreeSurfer \n  \nAutomated cortical surface reconstruction was performed on the T1 MPRAGE scans in FreeSurfer version 5.1 ( ) using previously described methods . Freesurfer's Longitudinal Processing Stream  was used to analyze the cortical changes between groups. The longitudinal processing stream creates an unbiased within-subject template space and image  using robust, inverse consistent registration . The template is used as an estimate to initialize subsequent segmentation processes for each time point, providing within-subject common information regarding anatomical structures. Several processing steps, such as skull stripping, Talaraich transforms, atlas registration as well as spherical surface maps and parcellations are then initialized with common information from this template, something which significantly increases reliability and statistical power . \n\nHere, the unbiased template was created for each subject using the three T1 MPRAGE scans collected over the course of one month. Any inaccuracies in the reconstruction of white matter and pial surfaces of individual subjects were visually inspected using the template reconstruction. Any inaccuracies identified by visual inspection were manually corrected on the template and applied to each of the three longitudinal scans. Cortical thickness was then computed for each longitudinal scan as the distance between the pial and white matter surfaces at each point across the cortical mantle. \n\nGroup analyses were performed by resampling each subject's data to the FreeSurfer average atlas, distributed as a part of the FreeSurfer software package. A standard General Linear Model (GLM) was used to compare the rate of change of cortical thickness between the verum and sham groups at each point across the cortical mantle. \n\nSimilar to our previous studies , we used an initial uncorrected threshold of p < 0.005 and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a FWHM of 10 mm in group analysis. A threshold of corrected p values (p ≤ 0.05) as obtained by using a Monte Carlo simulation cluster-wise correction with 10000 permutations was further applied. \n\nAfter computing the cortical thickness of the left posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pMPFC) for all 30 patients, repeated measurements was done to test for interactions between acupuncture mode (verum vs. sham) and time (across all three treatment sessions) using SPSS 18.0 Software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To eliminate the effect of possible confounding factors, the analysis was repeated using age and duration as covariates of no interest. \n\n\n#### Seed based functional connectivity analysis \n  \nThe fMRI data were preprocessed using Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) software (available at:  )  implemented in a MATLAB suite (Mathworks, Inc, Natick, Massachusetts). The software is based on Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) ( ) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit ( ) . \n\nThe fMRI images were slice timing corrected, head-motion corrected, coregistered to respective structural images for each subject, segmented, regressed out 6 rigid body motion, white matter, and CSF signal, normalized by using structural image unified segmentation, and then re-sampled to 3-mm cubic voxels. After linear detrending, data was filtered using typical temporal bandpass (0.01–0.08 Hz) to remove low frequency noise (including slow scanner drifts) and influences of higher frequencies reflecting cardiac and respiratory signals. Finally, similar to our previous study , the data was smoothed using a full width half maximum of 6 mm. \n\nFunctional connectivity analysis for individual subjects was carried out in DPARSF by applying a seed-region approach using the left pMPFC (x = 8, y = 40, z = 39, with 5 mm radius) that showed significant cortical thickness difference between the real and sham acupuncture as seed (see  ). Next, the averaged time course was obtained from the seed and the correlation analysis was performed in a voxel-wise way to generate the FC map. The correlation coefficient map was converted into Fisher-Z map by Fisher's r-to-z transform to improve the normality by calling functions in REST. \n\nTo investigate the functional connectivity of left pMPFC at a group level, individual Fisher-Z functional connectivity maps obtained from the functional connectivity analysis in DPARSF were used in the second level analysis using SPM8 software (available at:  ). \n\nTo study the modulation effect of acupuncture treatment, we compared the changes in pre-acupuncture treatment 6 and pre-acupuncture treatment 1 in the verum group to that of the sham group. We used pre-acupuncture resting state fMRI to avoid the residual effect of acupuncture needle stimulation . Due to the small sample size of each group (10 patients), we decided to combine the two verum acupuncture groups (low and high dose groups) because 1) the total treatment time, needle stimulation time, and reported sensations were the same in both verum groups, and 2) we found no clinical outcome differences between the two verum acupuncture groups; both verum acupuncture groups trended towards improvement when compared to sham treatment. \n\nSpecifically, to explore the difference between verum and sham after longitudinal acupuncture treatments, we input individual Fisher-Z maps from FC analyses for each subject into a full factorial model with two factors. The first factor had two levels (high and low dose verum acupuncture, and sham acupuncture) and the second factor had three levels (treatment 1, treatment 3, and treatment 6). Next, the contrast was created to look at the difference of differences, the first difference is FC changes between pre-acupuncture treatment 6 and pre-acupuncture treatment 1 for verum and sham acupuncture groups respectively, the second difference is FC changes between verum and sham group. \n\nWe used an initial threshold of p < 0.005 uncorrected with 10 voxels. We also report corrected p values as obtained from small volume correction in a priori regions of interest at a level of p ≤ 0.05 with FWE peak correction. Coordinates for small volume correction were based on peak coordinates obtained from previous studies on pain processing and pain modulation. The PAG , the ventral striatum  were corrected using spheres of 4 mm radius. The anterior MPFC  and the pregenual rostral anterior cingular cortex (rACC)  were corrected using spheres of 9 mm radius. \n\nConnectivity Fisher-Z values were extracted from areas surviving small volume correction for all groups and sessions. Repeated measurement was then performed using SPSS 18.0 Software to test for interaction between verum and sham group across treatment sessions. To eliminate the effect of possible confounding factors, all data analysis were repeated using age and duration as covariates of no interest. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nForty-four acupuncture naïve patients (19 females) aged 43–70 with a diagnosis of chronic osteoarthritis in the right and/or left knee participated in the study. Of the 44 patients who enrolled, 30 (13 females) completed all study procedures. Fourteen subjects did not complete the study due to problems with scheduling (6), ineligibility at screening (3), disinterest (2), claustrophobia (1), or inability to adhere to study requirements in scanner (2). Of the 14 subjects who dropped out of the study, four dropped out after randomization (2 from the low dose verum acupuncture group (one due to inability to adhere to study requirements in scanner, one due to schedule conflict) and 2 from the high dose verum acupuncture group (due to schedule conflict)). \n\n### Sensation evoked by acupuncture treatment \n  \nAs a treatment quality control, we measured the deqi sensation evoked by acupuncture treatment using the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) . The average total MASS score (sum of the intensities of each sensation) differed significantly across the acupuncture treatment groups (high (12.95 ± 7.55) vs. low (15.22 ± 11.90) vs. sham (4.82 ± 3.79)) (  F  (2,27) = 4.21, p = .026). Post hoc analyses showed the following differences: high vs low p = 0.55, high vs sham p = 0.04; low vs sham p = 0.01. These results indicate that verum acupuncture can produce significantly stronger sensations compared to sham acupuncture. There was no significant difference between the high and low dose acupuncture groups. A previous study by our group reported more details regarding the deqi sensations evoked by different treatment modalities in this sample . \n\n\n### Clinical outcomes \n  \nBaseline characteristics for the 30 patients who completed all study procedures are detailed in  . Two sample t-tests indicated no significant differences in clinical outcomes between the high and low dose groups for any of the KOOS subscale changes (post-treatment – pre-treatment) and both of the verum groups showed trends of improvements in the pain and other subscale scores when compared to the sham group ( ). Since the treatment duration and stimulation time, acupuncture needle-evoked sensation and the changes of clinical outcomes are similar between the high and low dose verum acupuncture groups, we pooled the data from these two groups to increase our power when comparing the differences between verum and sham acupuncture. \n\nRepeated measurements show that there was a significant interaction between acupuncture mode (verum vs. sham) and time (baseline vs. endpoint) for pain (F(1,28) = 5.596, p = .025, significant after Bonferroni correction) and a trend for function in daily living (F(1,28) = 3.223, p = .083). In addition, we found that secondary outcomes (KOOS subscale score for function in sport (F(1,27) = 4.252, p = .049) and quality of life (F(1, 28) = 4.682, p = .039) showed significant improvement in the real acupuncture group after treatment compared to the sham group. \n\n\n### Cortical thickness analysis: comparing verum to sham group \n  \nOf all 30 subjects, 27 (9 in sham acupuncture group) have all brain structure data at three time points for analysis. Cluster analysis showed significant difference between the verum and sham acupuncture groups at left pMPFC ( ). \n\nTo further explore the cortical thickness change in different groups, we extracted the peak vertex of pMPFC in each subjects across three sessions. Results showed that the cortical thickness remained static for the verum group across all three treatments sessions, but decreased for sham group ( ). Repeated measurements on the extracted data show that there was a highly significant interaction between acupuncture mode (verum vs. sham) and time (across all three treatment sessions) for cortical thickness of left pMPFC (F(2,24) = 7.519, p = 0.003). After control for age and duration, the interaction remains significant (F(2,22) = 7.461, p = 0.003). \n\n\n### Functional connectivity: comparing verum to sham group \n  \nUsing the left pMPFC that we obtained in structural analysis as a seed, we applied whole brain functional connectivity analysis comparing changes from pre-acupuncture treatment 1 to that of pre-acupuncture treatment 6 between the verum and sham groups. The FWE corrected P value, Fisher-Z value, and peak coordinates for all regions are shown in  . There is significantly stronger connectivity between the left pMPFC and PAG, rACC, anterior MPFC and ventral striatum for verum acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture after longitudinal acupuncture treatment ( ). When extracting the Fisher-Z connectivity values in these regions using the peak coordinates and a 4 mm sphere around the peak for all groups, repeated measurements show that there was a highly significant interaction between acupuncture mode (verum vs. sham) and time (across all three treatment sessions) for PAG (F(2,27) = 8.637, p = 0.001), rACC (F(2,27 = 8.885, p = 0.001), ventral striatum (F(2,27) = 3.931, p = 0.032), and anterior MPFC (F(2,27) = 6.927, p = 0.004). After using age and duration of the disorder as covariates of no interest, and repeat the analysis, all findings remain significant. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated the effects of longitudinal acupuncture treatment on structural and functional brain changes and clinical outcome measurements in knee OA patients. The results showed that acupuncture treatment can significantly modulate cortical thickness, functional connectivity, and clinical KOOS pain rating in OA patients. \n\nSpecifically, we found that the cortical thickness of left pMPFC decreased in sham group, but stayed the same in the verum group ( ). Previous studies  have found the region involved in conditioning placebo analgesia. Literature  suggest that the posterior region of the MPFC seems to be involved in control and monitoring of action. Other studies also suggest that the MPFC may integrate information from the external environment with stored internal representations , control top-down attention during conflict processing of alternative responses , and control monitor conflict with subsequent adjustment in performance . \n\nCortical thickness, especially that of the frontal region, dramatically declines with age . Also, the cortical thinning process is accentuated in chronic pain population . Our result suggest that the acupuncture may have prevented the natural rapid cortical thinning process of Knee OA patients by increasing the ability of the left pMPFC to control and modulate one's pain experience, which ultimately decreased the subjects' experience of pain. We observed cortical thickness decrease after one month of treatment, which is comparable in change in brain structure and duration of treatment with other published results . \n\nTo further explore other brain areas involved in pain modulation, we used the left posterior MPFC obtained from cortical thickness change as a seed for functional connectivity analysis. We found that comparing resting state functional connectivity changes from pre-acupuncture treatment 1 to that of pre-acupuncture treatment 6 between the verum and sham groups, the verum group showed stronger left posterior MPFC connectivity with the PAG, the right ventral striatum, the anterior MPFC, and the pregenual part of rostral ACC than did the sham group after longitudinal acupuncture treatments ( ). When extracting connectivity values from these regions and compared between verum and sham, there is significant interactions between verum and sham across all three sessions for all regions. \n\nDiffusion tensor imaging showed that the pMPFC has strong anatomical and functional connections with the anterior MPFC and ACC . The MPFC/rACC (including the pre-genual and sub-genual ACC) is a key region involved in the descending pain modulatory system . Studies also have shown that in knee OA patients, the lateral prefrontal cortex, the rACC, the bilateral insula, the parietal operculum, and the limbic cortical areas are involved in altered pain processing in OA . This suggests that the MPFC/rACC is a main area involved in the OA pain circuit. It also forms a core network with the PAG and the RVM (ACC-PAG-RVM network) for pain modulation even in the absence of a painful stimulus . Recent studies have shown that the functional connectivity fluctuations and structural connectivity between the PAG and the rACC predicted the mind wandering away from pain . \n\nVentral striatum is involved in processing many types of rewards including analgesia. Studies have shown the role of ventral striatum/accumbens in anticipation of analgesia . In a previous study, investigators found that the magnitude opioid analgesia indicated by pain rating changes can be predicted by neuronal response to painful noxious stimuli in nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum before administration of remifentanil . Taken together, these results highlight the role of reward network such as ventral striatum in opioid related pain modulation. \n\nOn top of the structural and functional connectivity changes, we also found that the verum group showed less clinical KOOS pain after acupuncture treatment compared with sham group, indicating acupuncture is an effective method at treating knee OA. In light of the above findings and previous studies  on the mechanisms involved in acupuncture analgesia demonstrating the involvement of the pain descending modulatory system, we speculate that by maintaining the structural cortical thickness of the left pMPFC and the connectivity between the left pMPFC and the pregenual rACC, anterior MPFC, right ventral striatum and PAG, the communication between these regions stays intact, which further enhance the pleasantness of rewarding stimuli, and restore the descending modulatory pathway. The ultimate result is improved clinical outcome in knee OA patients. \n\nThere are several limitations of this study. First, the sample size is relatively small. However, by combining the two acupuncture groups, we increased the power of the verum group, creating a 2:1 ratio between the verum and sham treatment conditions that will provide additional information on patients receiving active treatment . All reported main brain imaging results survived the stringent multiple comparison correction. Due to the longitudinal design of the study, we acquired fMRI scans at three time points, which may also increase the power of this study. \n\nOther potential limitations of this study include the potentially confounding effect of factors such as patient age and duration of chronic pain experienced by each patient. To address this concern, we repeated the analysis including age and duration of pain as covariates of no interest and re-analyzed the data. After this analysis, all findings remain significant. Thus, our main results do not change after controlling for these confounding factors. Furthermore, when KOOS pain scores were correlated with age and duration using multiple regression, we did not find any significant correlation. Further studies that include larger sample sizes are needed to validate the findings from our study. Finally, 6 minutes resting fMRI scans may potentially influence the test-retest reliability of seed based functional connectivity result. A longer duration of resting state scan should be applied in future study . \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this study, we found that verum acupuncture treatment can significantly modulate cortical thickness change, clinical outcome changes and FC associated with chronic pain in knee OA patients. Our findings suggest that verum acupuncture may enhance connectivity in the descending pain modulation pathway through connection with the posterior MPFC. A better understanding of the association in structural changes, FC and clinical outcomes and how treatment can modulate FC will deepen our knowledge and may ultimately lead to the acceptance of acupuncture in the main stream medicine and the development of mechanism-based therapies for treating chronic pain. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nX.Y.C.: data analysis and manuscript preparation; R.B.S.: data collection, data analysis and manuscript preparation; K.R.: data analysis; D.O.: manuscript preparation; J.K.: experimental design, data collection, analysis and manuscript preparation. \n\n\n## Additional Information \n  \n Clinical Trial Registration   URL:  .

The current study investigated how neuronal pathways implicated in response inhibition were affected in IA using a Go-Stop paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-three control subjects aged 15.2 ± 0.5 years (mean ± S.D.) and eighteen IA subjects aged 15.1 ± 1.4 years were studied. Effective connectivity within the response inhibition network was quantified using (stochastic) dynamic causal modeling (DCM). The results showed that the indirect frontal-basal ganglia pathway was engaged by response inhibition in healthy subjects. However, we did not detect any equivalent effective connectivity in the IA group. This suggests the IA subjects fail to recruit this pathway and inhibit unwanted actions. This study provides a clear link between Internet addiction as a behavioral disorder and aberrant connectivity in the response inhibition network. \n \n\n# Body\n \nInternet addiction (IA) is described as “problematic Internet use”  or “pathological Internet use”  and refers to the inability to control the use of the Internet . IA has become more prevalent over recent years. Previous studies suggest that Internet addiction is found in individuals from different areas and backgrounds . The prevalence of Internet addiction varies from 5.4% in Italy  to 18.3% in Britain . IA has been reported to lead to academic, social, and occupational impairment . Furthermore, the levels of loneliness , depression , compulsivity  and suicide ideation  are higher in Internet addiction relative to control subjects. In particular, problems are more commonly reported by younger and more recent Internet users . \n\nA significant and interesting finding is that IA is associated with poor impulse control . Individuals with IA usually use the Internet compulsively , despite adverse consequences; show diminished control over Internet use, and feel a great urge to be ‘online’ when disconnected . An early study reported that problematic Internet use of all twenty subjects studied met DSM-IV criteria for an impulse control disorder (ICD) not otherwise specified . Similarly, Treuer and co-authors  found that the prevalence of ICD features is high among Internet users and we have noted that adolescents with IA exhibit more impulsivity than controls . Based on these findings, it has been argued that IA may represent a subset of ICD . Understanding the neural basis underlying poor impulse control in IA subjects may therefore be of great importance for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder. \n\nRecently, there has been increasing interest in investigating the neurobiological mechanisms of IA using neuroimaging . These studies have revealed lower gray matter density , reduced orbitofrontal cortical thickness , abnormal white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) , impaired brain activity , and decreased functional connectivity  in individuals with IA. In particular, studies performed by Dong and colleagues have demonstrated altered brain activity that was associated with less efficient impulse inhibition in IA subjects . Lower NoGo-N2 amplitude, higher NoGo-P3 amplitude, and longer NoGo-P3 peak latency were detected in the IA group during a Go/NoGo task . In addition, significantly greater activity in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex was found in IA subjects using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . \n\nConvergent findings from previous studies indicate that impulsive responses are inhibited by engaging frontal-basal ganglia pathways involving the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) , the striatum , the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) , and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ; yet little is known about how these response inhibition pathways are affected in IA. We used stochastic dynamic causal modeling (DCM) – a technique that measures the directed (effective) connectivity among brain regions – to characterize a network including the IFG, striatum and pre-SMA in healthy subjects and IA adolescents while performing Go-Stop task. As a behavioral measure of impulsivity, this task assesses the capacity to inhibit a response that has already been initiated. Three hypotheses were tested: 1) IA subjects would show impaired response inhibition during the Go-Stop task; 2) the frontal-basal ganglia pathways would be disrupted in IA; 3) impaired response inhibition would be associated with abnormal information flow in the frontal-basal ganglia pathways. \n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral performance \n  \nThe IA group showed impaired response inhibition during the Go-Stop task ( ). The percentage of successfully inhibited responses was significantly lower in the IA group than the controls during a 50 ms delay task (p<0.05). However, when the task became harder, both groups demonstrated difficulty withholding their response. Although the control group performed better during the 150 ms and 250 ms delay tasks, the differences did not reach significance (p<0.05). \n\n\n### Conventional fMRI \n  \nConventional fMRI analysis (using statistical parametric mapping) revealed that the response inhibition network, including the right IFG, the right striatum and the left pre-SMA were activated in the control group, when the subjects tried to inhibit their responses ( ,  ). The right IFG and striatum survived small volume correction:   p  <0.05, FWE corrected. In contrast, only the left superior frontal gyrus, the left and the right striatum were activated during response inhibition in the IA subjects ( ,  ). Two-sample   t   tests (at the group level) showed that activations in bilateral IFG and the right striatum were weaker in the IA group compared to the control group ( ,  ). This cluster survived correction at p<0.05 for a small volume correction. On the other hand, we observed increased activation of the left superior frontal gyrus in the IA group ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Effective connectivity \n  \nSignificant connections at the group level (one-sample   t  -test at p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons) are shown in  . In all subjects, V2 exerted a significant positive influence on the activity of the pre-SMA. However, the connectivity between the IFG and the pre-SMA, between the pre-SMA and the striatum, and from the IFG to the striatum was only significant in the control group ( ). Conversely, the effective connectivity from the pre-SMA to V2 was only significant in the IA group ( ). \n\nFinally, we calculated the correlation between behavioral performance and the strength of the connections. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the connection from the IFG to the striatum and the percentage of successfully inhibited responses during the 150 ms and 250 ms delay tasks in all subjects. The behavioral performance was also negatively correlated with the strength of the connection from V2 to the pre-SMA, from the IFG to the pre-SMA, and from the pre-SMA to the IFG ( ). These results provide a behavioral validation of the quantitative effective connectivity estimates based purely upon the fMRI data. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of the present study was to investigate how neural pathways underlying response inhibition were affected in IA using a Go-Stop paradigm. Our results showed that core brain regions in the response inhibition network – including the IFG and the striatum – exhibited stronger activation in the control group than in the IA group. Crucially, a DCM analysis revealed directed connectivity between the frontal cortex and the striatum that was consistent (significant) in control subjects. However, we did not detect any significant effective connectivity between regions in the frontal-basal ganglia pathways in the IA group. These findings suggest that abnormalities in the neural pathways in the fronto-basal ganglia system underlie behavioral response inhibition in the IA group. \n\nIn this study, we found that the percentage of successfully inhibited responses was significantly lower in the IA group, suggesting impaired response inhibition in IA adolescents. This result is in line with previous studies that reported poor impulse control in IA . Moreover, conventional fMRI analysis detected reduced activation of the bilateral IFG and the right striatum in the IA group during response inhibition. Convergent findings from human studies have suggested that the right IFG is crucial for response inhibition . Brain activations in this region have been shown to be correlated with successful inhibitory control . Patients with lesions of the right frontal lobe needed more time to suppress a response than controls. Furthermore, IFG damage is also associated with stop signal reaction time (SSRT) . Stimulation of the IFG impaired the ability to inhibit an action . Considering the critical role of the right IFG in response inhibition, hypoactivation of this region may account for the poor impulse control observed in our study and previous studies of IA subjects . \n\nNeurobiologically, response inhibition has been suggested to be mediated via the indirect and the hyperdirect basal ganglia pathways . The hyperdirect pathway is thought to rapidly suppress a response through a projection from the frontal cortex to the STN . In contrast, the indirect pathway is thought to be slower, because it has more synapses than the hyperdirect pathway . In the indirect pathway, cortical outputs are first sent to the striatum. Neuronal signals are then passed to the globus pallidus pars externa and, finally, the STN. \n\nBecause we did not detect significant activation of the STN during response inhibition, this region was not included in our DCM – and thus we did not assess the integrity of the hyperdirect pathway. However, our results provide evidence for a key role of the indirect pathway in response inhibition. Our DCM results support the notion that when a stop signal is presented, the sensory input is relayed to the frontal cortex through a connection from V2 to the pre-SMA. The pre-SMA then communicates with the IFG via bidirectional connections. Finally, the IFG sends a stop command to the striatum to suppress the unwanted response. \n\nThe results of the DCM analysis are in line with findings from recent effective connectivity studies that also implicate the indirect pathway in suppressing responses . Using a novel method (ancestral graphs), Jahfari and co-authors found that the indirect pathway between the cortex and the caudate played an important role in response inhibition. They also noted that higher connection strengths between the cortex and the caudate were associated with more efficient response inhibition . Findings from effective connectivity studies are supported by studies using tractography data . A projection between the IFG and pre-SMA is consistently reported in these studies . Fiber tracts connecting the striatum with the inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis (IFGoper) were also reported in a recent diffusion tensor imaging study . Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have shown similar results : stimulation of the IFG was found to increase right striatal activation, implicating the indirect pathway in reactive inhibition . \n\nOne of the main contributions of this study is the detection of aberrant effective connectivity within the response inhibition network in IA. In contrast to control subjects, consistent directed connectivity between the IFG and the pre-SMA, between the pre-SMA and the striatum, and from the IFG to the striatum were not detected in the IA group, suggesting a failure to recruit the indirect pathway to suppress unwanted actions in Internet addiction. \n\nOur hypotheses were further verified by the association between connection strengths and subjects’ performance during the Go-Stop task. Stronger IFG-striatum connections are associated with more successful response inhibition. This makes perfect sense: according to the DCM analysis, the connection strength describes the strength of a coupling in terms of the rate at which neuronal responses are elicited in the target region (in other words connection strengths are effectively rate constants in 1/s, Hz) . Thus a larger connection strength suggests a faster effect on the target region, resulting in more efficient termination of the action. In contrast, lower IFG-striatum connection strengths in the IA subjects represent slower suppressing of the responses through the indirect pathway, leading to failures in inhibiting responses. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nTwenty-eight adolescents with IA – as diagnosed by the modified Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire (YDQ) for Internet Addiction  – and 27 well-matched healthy subjects participated in this study. The IA subjects were outpatients of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University while the controls were recruited from high schools in Changsha. All subjects (and one of their parents) received a structured clinical interview from two experienced psychiatrists, which was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). None of the participants in this study fulfilled any DSM-IV axis I disorders. Four healthy adolescents and 8 IA subjects were excluded from this study due to a failure to record behavioral data during the Go-Stop task. In addition, two IA subjects were removed from further analyses due to excessive head motion. Finally, 23 controls and 18 IA subjects were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age (mean ± S.D., IA: 15.1 ± 1.4 years versus control: 15.2 ± 0.5 years), ethnicity or education ( , p<0.05, two-sample   t   test). All subjects' caretakers gave written informed consents. The study was conducted according to the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China. \n\nYDQ is a questionnaire proposed by Young to diagnose Internet addiction based on the DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling . YDQ consists of eight criteria ( ). Young asserted that those who fulfill five or more of the eight criteria should be considered Internet-dependent. The initial Young's YDQ criteria were later modified by Beard and Wolf . They recommended that only those who met all of the first five criteria and at least one of the last three criteria should be considered Internet-dependent. The modified YDQ was used in the present study for the diagnosis of IA. \n\n\n### The Go-Stop Task \n  \nAs shown in   this study used a block design. The scanning session began with a 70 s period of the Go-Stop task, which was followed by rest block that lasted for 20 s. The word ‘rest’ was fixated during the rest block, which was then followed by another task block. Rest and task blocks were repeated six times in each experiment and the scanning session lasted 9 min. \n\nGo-Stop is a paradigm developed to assess the capacity to inhibit a response that has already been initiated. It requires participants to response to a series of five-digit numbers presented in black on a white background. There are three trial types: no-stop, stop and novel trials ( ). Participants are told to response with a button press to a number that is identical to the previous number presented in black, and this is a no-stop trial. A stop trial presents a number that matches the one before it, but it changes unpredictably from black to red at some specified stimulus onset asynchrony (50, 150, 250, or 350 ms) after stimulus onset. No button is pressed during a stop trial. Novel trials present randomly generated non-matching numbers in black. In the current study, the intervals (50, 150, 250, or 350 ms) – during which the target remained black (no-stop) before turning red (stop) – occurred with equal probability. Number stimuli were presented on the screen for 500 ms once every 2 s. The participants were instructed to response to a no-stop trial before the number disappeared from the screen but withhold response to a stop trial or novel trial . \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nA PHILIPS 3.0T whole-body scanner was used for acquiring the functional MRI images. A T2*-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, 4 mm slice thickness, typically 36 axial slices, 64 × 64 matrix size, 24 × 24 cm FOV, 90°-flip angle) was used to measure blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing of the fMRI data used SPM8 ( ). First, a six-parameter rigid body transformation (three rotations, and three translations) was used to realign the functional images to the first image of each session. Then images were normalized to a MNI EPI template with affine registration followed by a nonlinear transformation, using a voxel size of 2 × 2 × 2 mm. Finally, an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel was used to smooth the data. \n\n\n### Statistical parametric mapping \n  \nSubject-specific responses were modeled using a general linear model (GLM) and standard (statistical parametric mapping) procedures: No-stop, stop and novel trials were modeled after convolution with a canonical hemodynamic basis function. The six motion parameters were included to model the movement correlated effects. In the first-level (within subject) analyses, we determined the contrast “stop>baseline”, which allowed us to identify brain regions that were activated or deactivated when the subject tried to inhibit responses. The resulting contrast images were then entered into the second-level (between-subject) analyses. Statistical parametric maps based on one-sample   t  -tests were used to illustrate brain activation during response inhibition for each group, while two-sample   t  -tests were performed to determine group differences of brain activation in the Go-Stop task. As this study focused on the response inhibition network, small volume correction was employed to a priori regions of interest: the IFG, striatum and pre-SMA. Sphere ROIs (radius = 25 mm) centered at peak coordinates as reported by Aron et al.  were constructed. \n\n\n### Dynamic causal modeling \n  \nEffective connectivity analysis was performed using DCM12. The basic idea behind DCM is to treat the brain as a dynamic input-state-output system that is driven by experimental inputs and produces outputs (BOLD responses). Each region has a (hidden) neuronal state corresponding to neuronal or synaptic activity and four (hidden) hemodynamic states representing a vasodilatory signal, blood flow, blood volume and deoxyhemoglobin content. At the neuronal level, the neuronal state equations describe how neuronal activity in one region is affected by neuronal activity in others and how these influences are modulated by experimental inputs. The neuronal state equations are supplemented with the hemodynamic state equations that transform the neuronal activity in each region to observed BOLD response . \n\nIn this study, we used stochastic DCM. Stochastic DCM differs from conventional deterministic DCM by allowing for endogenous or random fluctuations in unobserved (hidden) neuronal and physiological states, known technically as system or state-noise . Compared to deterministic DCM, stochastic DCM has been shown to provide more accurate parameter estimates . Moreover, stochastic DCM can be used to study effective connectivity between brain regions in the resting state by exploiting spontaneous fluctuations in activity to estimate effective connectivity . \n\nIn order to reduce the model complexity, we concatenated the three inputs (the no-stop, stop and novel trials) to one input for the DCM analysis. In this case, we performed a GLM analysis with regressor for the task condition and six regressors represented the movement effects. For each subject, we determined the contrast “task>rest”. \n\nBased on the group analysis – and on previous studies of the neural network associated with response inhibition – three ROIs were defined: the right IFG, the right striatum, and the left pre-SMA. Because subjects responded to visual stimuli (i.e., a series of five-digit numbers in black on a white background), activity within the motor system can be assumed to be driven by the visual system. Thus, we added a fourth region or node (V2) to our model. Because we did not detect significant activation of the STN during response inhibition in the subjects, this region was not included in the DCM. Subject-specific ROIs were centered on the local maximum of SPMs testing for “task minus rest”. For some subjects, the locations of the ROIs were slightly adjusted to make sure the same ROI for each subject was located within the same anatomical gyrus as the group maximum. For the pre-SMA in one IA subject and the V2 in one healthy subject, the coordinates of the group maximum were used because we did not detect significant activation of the region in these subjects. The time series for all ROIs were extracted from a sphere region (radius = 6 mm).   shows the locations and the time series of the four ROIs. \n\nFor the DCM analysis, a fully connected model was first constructed. Specifically, visual input was modeled as a driving or exogenous input to V2 and subject-specific DCMs were fully and reciprocally connected (resulting in 12 connections among four nodes). Given our primary interest was to detect differences in effective connectivity between the groups; we did not model any bilinear or modulatory effects. In other words, we estimated the average connectivity under the task-set of response inhibition, assuming that endogenous fluctuations in neuronal activity (state noise) would model condition specific responses. The full connected model for each subject was inverted using generalized filtering as described previously . A network discovery scheme was then used to identify the optimal model pooling over all subjects . Subject specific parameter estimates (posterior means) under the optimal model were then taken to the second, between-subject level analysis using a classical random-effects analysis. This allowed us to summarize the findings from the subject-specific DCMs at the group level, using classical statistics (  t  -tests). \n\n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nF.L.C., L.Y.S., D.W.H. and S.Q.Y. designed the project.

Our previous fMRI study demonstrated that amygdala reactivity was independently predicted by affective-cognitive styles (phobic prone or eating disorders prone) and genotype of the serotonin transporter in a discrimination task of fearful facial expressions. Since the insula is associated with the subjective evaluation of bodily states and is involved in human feelings, we explored whether its activity could also vary in function of individual differences. In the present fMRI study, the association between dispositional affects and insula reactivity has been examined in two groups of healthy participants categorized according to affective-cognitive styles (phobic prone or eating disorders prone). Images of the faces of partners and strangers, in both painful and neutral situations, were used as visual stimuli. Interaction analyses indicate significantly different activations in the two groups in reaction to a loved one's pain: the phobic prone group exhibited greater activation in the left posterior insula. These results demonstrate that affective-cognitive style is associated with insula activity in pain empathy processing, suggesting a greater involvement of the insula in feelings for a certain cohort of people. In the mapping of individual differences, these results shed new light on variability in neural networks of emotion. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAn important goal of integrating psychology and neuroimaging is to understand the detailed mechanisms mediating inter-individual differences in human behavior. Individual variability in emotion processing may be associated with genetic variations as well as with psychological predispositions  – . In order to refine the integration between genetics and psychology, more psychological tools would be useful in the attempt to grasp the complexity of human variability. Several authors consider the dispositional affect to be the predominant modality of emotional engagement with the self and with the environment  – . Our concept of dispositional affect developed based on previous works on the relationship between cognitive styles and attachment patterns  –  in some psychopathological conditions  – . It emphasizes the need to account for the way in which each person, in dealing with others and the different circumstances of everyday life, feels situated in the environment  – . Within this new perspective, two general dispositional affects can be defined: primarily based on basic emotions or primarily based on emotions which are co-perceived through others (non-basic emotions)  – . Subjects with a better knowledge of basic emotions are said to have an inward disposition (not to be confounded with introversion-see below)  – ,  – . Inward subjects tend to be more viscerally aware, more sensitive in the detection of changes in bodily states occurring during emotions and feelings. In brief, their focus is primarily directed towards a frame of reference that predominantly uses a body-centered coordinate system  – . Subjects with a better knowledge of non-basic emotions, i. e. emotions that require some kind of relationship between the self and external points of reference, are said to have an outward disposition (not to be confounded with extraversion -see below)  – ,  . Outward subjects tend to be more externally aware, and in this sense, their focus is primarily directed towards a frame of reference that predominantly uses an externally-anchored coordinate system, i. e. contexts, people or rules and norms  – . \n\nDifferent dispositional affects could explain behavioral data on field-dependent or independent perceptual processing  , on independent or interdependent self-construal  ,  , as well as on variability of interoceptive sensitivity in emotional processing  – . \n\nWithin these two general dispositional affects, five categories are identified as affective-cognitive styles among which two are particularly orthogonal: 1) phobic prone individuals (inward), and 2) eating disorders prone individuals (outward). It is necessary to underline that the terms phobic prone and eating disorders prone do not necessarily imply that these subjects are at higher risk of pathological phobias or of eating disorders. Phobic prone individuals rely predominantly on basic emotions and are characterized by a sense of permanence of Self predominantly centered on the visceral reading of emotional states. The “hypercognition”   of basic emotions (especially fear) plays a central role in the development and regulation of a stable perception of Self. In fact, the recurrent activation of basic emotions is matched by a subjective experience of “gut feelings”. As a result these individuals tend to regulate their relationship both with others and in accordance with the ongoing situations through bringing internal states into focus, thereby allowing their personal stability to coincide with the stability of their own bodily conditions (body-bounded sense of self). Therefore the bodily-emotional condition and its control (through various strategies) are centrally salient to these individuals in regulating their emotional life. On the other hand, eating disorders prone individuals are characterized by a sense of permanence of Self that emerges simultaneously and in tune with the perception of a source of meaning  ,  – . While this produces a recognition of one's own internal states stemming from a focus on the real or imagined other in ongoing situations  ,  – , at the same time the “outward” referent becomes the source of information (perceived as source of expectations, of judgment, of emulation or as a pole of opposition, of challenge, etc.) to recognize one's own emotional experience. In this regard, eating disorders prone individuals tend to be more socially aware and to regulate their personal stability on a coordinate system which is outwardly anchored to a real or imagined other. One effect of this situational and social interest is that those emotions which emerge through mediated affective engagement (non basic emotions) can change more easily -since they tax the system's visceral resources less– and with greater flexibility with regard to the flow of ongoing events. \n\nThe insula plays a key role in homeostatic afferent activity that engenders distinct subjective bodily feelings  , and it is involved in human feeling processing  – . Therefore, its reactivity could be associated with individual differences. Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for the direct involvement of the insular cortex in the so-called “pain matrix” during empathy for pain  – . However, current debates on empathy have raised unanswered questions about individual differences  – . To our knowledge, no fMRI studies have been conducted previously with this objective. Therefore, the present study was carried out to determine whether and how individual differences in affective-cognitive styles are associated with insula reactivity during affective empathic responses to directly perceived feelings of others. \n\nWith this objective, two groups of healthy subjects were categorized according to their affective-cognitive style, phobic prone or eating disorders prone. In order to study the role of the affective-cognitive styles, salient visual stimuli depict a loved one, in both painful and neutral expressions. Unfamiliar faces were used as controls. We predicted greater insular cortex activity associated with the subjective evaluation of their condition   in the phobic prone subjects, because of their relatively greater focus on a body-centered coordinate system as a frame of reference. More precisely, we hypothesized that the activation of the insular cortices during a visual experience of a loved one's pain would differ according to group. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFifteen participants were phobic prone (PP) (6 females; mean age 39.2; standard deviation [SD] 7.4) and 15 were eating disorders prone (EDP) (5 females; mean age 34.4; standard deviation [SD] 8.65). The couples enrolled had been together in a committed relationship for the last three years and had been living together for at least one year. To assign the participants to a group, they were assessed with a semi-structured interview  –  and the Personality Meaning Questionnaire (PMQ)   one month before the scanning session. Concordance between the two investigators was 100%. As in our previous study  – , the semi-structured interview was administered independently by two trained investigators who were blind to each other's results. The aim of the semi-structured interview was to assess the key themes characterizing different affective-cognitive styles in the matter of emotional activation, duration and regulation. The semi-structured interview was divided into three consecutive steps. The subject was asked to give a detailed account of two meaningful emotional experiences involving anger and fear. After the account, the interviewer marked the characteristics of the appraisal, regulation and duration of the emotional experiences. If necessary, the interviewer asked for more details and then, the interviewer assessed the underlying predominant affective-cognitive style. The PP key themes detected were the tendency a) to focus on the visceral bodily states once the basic emotions have been triggered (automatic appraisal), b) to have the subjective perception of inability to modify these emotions after they have been triggered (duration), c) to have control over bodily-emotional condition aimed at limiting the emotional intensity; fear in these subjects lasts just as long as the perception of not being in control (regulation). Instead, EDP key themes detected were the tendency a) to focus on the outward referent recognized as the source of one's own emotional states (reflective appraisal), b) to have the subjective perception of capability to rapidly change these emotions by modifying the simultaneous focus on a different point of reference (duration), c) to adjust their personal stability to the perceived source of reference; being without a point of reference is perceived by these subjects as a feeling of emptiness (regulation). The PMQ questions on which PP subjects tend to score higher identify a score of need for emotional over-control in situations that may be felt as potentially dangerous (PP score)  . The questions on which EDP subjects score higher identify a score for need for consent and approval, sensitivity to judgment, and vulnerability to criticism (EDP score)  . \n\nA behavioral evaluation of how subjects in each group processed empathy for pain was obtained through the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)   comprised of four subtests which measure dispositional empathy based on the notion that empathy consists of a set of separate but related constructs. In order to support the behavioral characterization of each dispositional affect style in terms of body perception, we also employed two subtests of the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ)  : the “Awareness of Bodily Processes” (ABP) and the “Autonomic Nervous System Reactivity” (ANSR). The study was approved by the local IRB. Subjects also completed a series of questionnaires identifying different personality characteristics, such as the NEO Five Factors Inventory  , the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI)  , the Positive and Negative Attitude Scale (PANAS)  , the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI)  , and the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ)  . Other demographic variables included years of education, parental socioeconomic status  , total IQ (assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised [WAIS-R]), and handedness   ( ). Exclusion criteria included a history of drug or alcohol abuse, previous head trauma with loss of consciousness, pregnancy, and any significant medical or psychiatric conditions as evaluated with the SCID interview. \n   Questionnaire Scores for Phobic prone and Eating disorders prone Groups.        \n\n### Ethics statement \n  \nThe present study was approved by the Comitato Etico Indipendente Locale of the Azienda Ospedaliera “Ospedale Policlinico Consorziale” of Bari. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants before participation. \n\n\n### Functional MRI data \n  \nfMRI data were acquired on a 3T GE (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) MRI scanner with a gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence and covered 26 axial slices (5 mm thick, 1 mm gap), encompassing the entire cerebrum and most of the cerebellum (TR 2; field of view, 24 cm; matrix, 64×64, a voxel size of 3.75×3.75×5 mm). For each scan, a total of 330 EPI volume images were acquired. \n\n\n### Visual Stimuli \n  \nVisual stimuli consisted of 160 pictures (720×576 pixels), 40 for each condition, depicting faces of a loved one and of actors, in both painful and neutral situations. Two professional actors, a female and a male, were enrolled as models for the pictures of unfamiliar faces ( ). Facial expressions of actors and partners were filmed in a session previous to scanning. Painful facial expressions were elicited by mechanical stimuli during a pain threshold test. Two investigators reviewed the videotaped recordings and selected by consensus the picture frames conveying evidence of the intensity of the experience of pain, based on Ekman and Friesen's Facial Action Coding System (FACS)  . \n   Sample of visual stimuli: actors' neutral and painful facial expression.    \n\n### General fMRI Procedures \n  \nFunctional MRI scanning consisted of one run in an event-related design. To optimize the stimulus sequence, we used a genetic algorithm  . The exact timing of the occurrence of each event was generated with the genetic algorithm, using an average inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1300 ms, equal numbers of on and off events, and optimization for hemodynamic response detection. Visual stimuli were presented for 1400 ms in a random order. During the interstimulus interval (ISI), a crosshair was presented. Total run time was about 11.2 minutes. Visual stimuli were presented using Presentation 10.5 ( ). During the scanning session participants were required to perform a discrimination task between known and unknown faces, in both painful and neutral situations. Responses were given via a button box which recorded accuracy (i. e. percent correct responses) and reaction time (measured in milliseconds). Before the scanning session, each participant completed the STAI questionnaire   to evaluate their state of anxiety. After scanning, participants were asked to rate the intensity of others' pain and of their own feelings of unpleasantness on the basis of the same visual stimuli by using a computerized visual analogue scale (VAS) with target words ranging from “no pain” to “extreme pain” and from “no effect” to “extreme unpleasantness”. Participants were not informed of their partners' role in the study before the scanning session. \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nImages were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK), implemented in MatLab 7.2 (MathWorks™). For each subject, functional images were first slice-timing corrected, using the middle slice acquired in time as a reference, and then spatially corrected for head movement, using a least-squares approach and six-parameter rigid body spatial transformations. They were then normalized into a standard stereotactic space (Montreal Neurological Institute MNI template) by using a 12-parameter affine model and spatially smoothed with a three-dimensional Gaussian filter (10 mm full-width at half-maximum). \n\nImages were analyzed using a standard random-effect procedure. The time series of functional MR images obtained from each participant were analyzed separately. The effect of the experimental paradigm was estimated on a voxel-by-voxel basis, according to the general linear model extended to allow the analysis of fMRI data as time series. Low-frequency noise was removed with a high-pass filter (time constant 128 s). The onset of each trial constituted a neural event that was modeled through a canonical hemodynamic response function, chosen to represent the relationship between neural activation and hemodynamic changes. Serial correlation in the fMRI time series was estimated with a restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) algorithm using an autoregressive AR(1) model during parameter estimation, assuming the same correlation structure for each voxel. The ReML estimates were then used to whiten the data. These subject-specific models were used to compute four contrast images per subject (partner's neutral face, partner's painful face, unknown neutral face, unknown painful face), each representing the estimated amplitude of the hemodynamic response in one experimental condition. Contrast images from all subjects of the two groups (inward and outward) were entered at the second level into a random-effects model repeated-measures 2×2×2 ANOVA with non-sphericity correction (as implemented in SPM5). For interaction analyses and direct comparisons of the two groups a 2×2×2 factorial design was used: a group factor (inward-outward), a painful facial expressions factor (painful-neutral faces) and a “familiar” facial expressions (partner's-unfamiliar faces). Across all analyses, the statistical threshold was set at p<0.001 uncorrected with an extent threshold of 8 contiguous voxels. Fisher's LSD test was used for post-hoc comparisons. All MNI coordinate spaces were converted to the Talairach coordinate system by icbm2tal ( ).Anatomic and Brodmann's areas labeling of the activity of clusters was performed with the Talairach Daemon database ( ). \n\nIn order to investigate signal intensity of BOLD responses, regions-of-interests (ROIs) were defined as spheres with 6 mm diameter centered at the peak voxel in the activated clusters identified in the 3-way interaction analysis. The parameter estimates of signal intensity in ROIs were computed from the first-level analysis in each participant and successively compared with a repeated measures ANOVA, with four facial expressions as within-effect factors and with dispositional affects as between-subjects factors. \n\nIn order to evaluate any differences between groups for VAS ratings intensity of the others' pain and of their own feelings of unpleasantness, a 2×2×2 factorial design was used with the group factor (PP-EDP), pain factor (painful-neutral faces) and familiarity factor (partner's-unknown faces). T tests were used to verify any difference s between groups due to the familiarity factor in VAS ratings of the intensity of others' pain and of their own feelings of unpleasantness. T tests were employed to evaluate any differences between groups in questionnaires. Repeated measures ANOVAs with dispositional affects as the between-subjects factor were carried out to analyze any differences in reaction time and performance accuracy. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics and questionnaires \n  \nT tests and χ  indicated that the two groups of subjects were well matched for age, gender, parental education and years of education (all p>0.2). T tests of the IRI scores only revealed a significant difference between groups for one subtest, “Perspective Taking” (PT), which measures the reported tendency to spontaneously adopt the psychological point of view of others in everyday life (t-value  = −3.65 df = 28 p<0,001): the EDP group had higher PT scores than the PP group ( ). Interestingly, subjects in the PP group had higher scores than outward subjects for the “Awareness of bodily processes” (ABP) subtest (t-value  = 2.6 df = 28 p<0.03) ( ). These results provide evidence that the two groups have different questionnaire response rates: the PP group was more likely to be aware of bodily processes and a less prone to adopt another's point of view, whereas the opposite tendency was seen in the EDP group, i.e. more likely to adopt another's point of view and less likely to be aware of bodily processes. T tests of the other questionnaires did not indicate any significant difference between groups (df = 28; NEO: t-value = 0.5 p>0.62; TCI: t-value = 1.67 p>0.11; PANAS: t-value = 1.4 p>0.17; EPI: t-value = 0.8 p>0.4; BFQ: t-value = 1.96 p>0.06), suggesting that the two groups of subjects did not significantly differ on other aspects of personality identified by these questionnaires ( ). \n\nOn the other hand, the VAS ratings ANOVA revealed that no significant interactions occurred between the group factor, pain factor and familiarity factor, in both the evaluation of pain intensity in others and in the personal experience of unpleasantness when observing others' pain. No significant differences due to the familiarity factor were found between groups in VAS ratings of the intensity of others' pain or in participants' own feelings of unpleasantness. \n\nIn addition, in a repeated measures ANOVA with the dispositional affects factor as the between-subjects factor showed no differences between the two groups in terms of reaction time and performance accuracy. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging Results \n  \nFirst of all, the main effects of pain, familiarity and affective-cognitive style factors were investigated. Observing pain in others (painful faces>neutral faces) caused activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal gyrus (BA 46) (DLPFC), left cerebellum and right red nucleus (p<0.001 uncorrected) ( ). In contrast, the main effect of the familiarity factor [partner's faces>unknown faces] was associated with activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA9), the right medial prefrontal cortex (BA10) and the left posterior cingulate cortex (BA31) (p<0.001 uncorrected) ( ). Previous studies have found these same areas to be involved in cognitive and emotional processing of pain empathy and familiarity. The main effect of the affective-cognitive style was interesting to observe, as the group factor produced a significant effect. Indeed, activity in the left posterior insula (BA13) and the right parietal lobe (BA40) (SI) (p<0.001 uncorrected) was greater in the PP group; whereas in the EDP group, the BOLD response was greater in the bilateral DLPFC (BA9), bilateral precuneus (BA7) and left posterior cingulate cortex (BA23) (PCC) (p<0.001 uncorrected) ( ,  ). Interestingly, in the PP group, greater activation was seen in those areas usually involved in the bodily states, even though no real bodily experience was administered. \n   3D rendering (image threshold at p<0.05 FWE corrected) of the BOLD response of the main effects of group factor.  \nSignificant activation: INWARD: left posterior insula BA13, and the right parietal lobe SII BA40; OUTWARD: bilateral DLPFC BA9, bilateral precuneus BA7. 2-D overlay with multiple slices of insular activation in each group. \n     Main effects of pain and familiarity factors p<0.001 uncorrected, k = 8.           Inter-group comparisons p<0.001 uncorrected, k = 8.        \nAt this point, the three-way interaction between affective-cognitive style, the observed facial expression, and the familiarity of the face was explored. This interaction demonstrated differential activity in the left insula (BA13) (x = −41 y = −4 z = 10) at a more lenient threshold (p<0.01) ( ). Moreover, the interaction also indicated differential activity in left precuneus (BA31) (x = −26 y = −71 z = 35; p<0.001) ( ) and in the right mPFC (BA10) (x = 11 y = 60 z = −5; p<0.001) ( ,  ). ANOVA analyses of parameter estimates from these clusters indicated greater activity in the left insula for the PP group during processing of partners' painful expressions and of strangers' neutral expressions. On the other hand, in the EDP group, the left precuneus was more engaged and the right mPFC (BA10) was less deactivated during processing of partners' painful expressions and of strangers' neutral expressions ( ). This finding suggests that a significant correlation was present between the group factor and the differences observed among the participants. \n   Left insula with significantly greater activation in the inward group, obtained with the the 3-way interaction analyses, identified at p<0.001 uncorrected, Ke = 8 voxels.  \n a  ) the left posterior insula (peak coordinates x = −41, y = −4, z = 10; p<0.01 uncorrected, Ke = 8 voxels);   b  ) the left precuneus (peak coordinates x = −26, y = −71, z = 35);   c  ) the right medial PFC (peak coordinates x = 11, y = 60, z = −5).

Imaging data revealed that the involvement of the insular region was quantitatively different in these two groups of healthy subjects categorized according to their affective-cognitive styles. Interaction analyses demonstrated that different brain regions were more involved in each group, particularly while processing partners' painful facial expressions. Indeed, in PP subjects, more activation was seen in the left posterior insula, whereas EDP subjects had greater engagement in the left precuneus and mPFC. \n\nUp to the present, several studies have provided results that assign a key role to the insula during the direct experience of pain and during a vicarious experience of another person's pain  – ,  – . These studies significantly contributed to the development of the current topic concerning insular cortex engagement in emotions  – . Concerning the individual differences issue in pain empathy  – , our results suggest that dispositional affects act upon the neural regions that subserve the ability to appreciate others' pain. At least two conclusions can be drawn from this fact. First, the role played by the insular cortex in the affective response to others' pain is central for a certain cohort of people. Secondly, the engagement of the insula in emotional experiences is modulated by dispositional affects. \n\nA primary interoceptive representation of the physiological condition of the body has been shown to exist in the posterior insular cortex  ,  – ; thereby it is involved in human feelings  – . As suggested by Craig's studies, a phylogenetically new homeostatic afferent pathway from lamina I, through the thalamus, to the posterior insular cortex provides a direct representation of homeostatic afferent activity that engenders distinct bodily feelings such as pain and visceral sensations  ,  . Thus, it seems that the regions with more activity in the PP group engage first-order mapping structures like the posterior insula and the somatosensory cortex/SI- recipients of signals from the internal milieu and the viscera  ,  ,  – . These results are consistent with the theoretical construct of inwardness described by our model  – . As they are more aware of the changes in bodily states occurring during emotions and feelings, these subjects had greater involvement of an area such as the posterior insula associated with regulating bodily states. \n\nIn contrast, the EDP group had greater activation in fronto-posterior parietal areas, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus, while processing partners' painful facial expressions. The role of the precuneus has been demonstrated in processing self-relevant contextual information  – , in attention tracking  – , and in attentional non spatial shifts  . On the other hand, the mPFC/BA10 as a whole plays a role in self-referential processing  ,  –  and social cognition  ,  . It has also been suggested that the mPFC/BA10 influences the attentional balance between self-generated and perceptual information, rather than being exclusively involved in processing self-generated information  . Thus, the precuneus (and interconnected posterior cingulate) and medial prefrontal cortices are engaged in continuous information gathering and representation of the self and the external world (“co-perception”), as well as in the assessment of self-relevant sensations  – ,  ,  – . Such results seem to be consistent with our model's of outwardness, as these subjects preferentially use an externally-anchored coordinate system as a reference frame during emotions and feelings. \n\nThe greater response in the left insula in the PP group to unfamiliar neutral faces, and in the left precuneus and right mPFC in the EDP group, could be related to the processing of the emotional significance of ambiguous stimuli when making a judgment  . This speculation is supported by the observation that both groups had similar BOLD responses. \n\nThe activation of different regions for the two groups cannot be attributed to dispositional variables such as sensitivity to pain expression: the two groups did not differ in their ratings of the intensity of pain in others or in their personal feelings of unpleasantness when observing others' pain. Moreover, behavioral data support the inter-group differences: PP subjects scored higher on indexes of internal body perceptions on the on the “Awareness of Bodily Processes” questionnaire  , while EDP subjects scored higher on indexes of “Perspective Taking” questionnaire  . \n\nIt is interesting to note that our results are in line with those of Critchley's study   which used a synchronized or desynchronized heartbeat tone signal in contrast with a series of ten similarly timed tones that either did or did not include an oddball tone. In this study, the interaction between desynchronized timing and interoceptive attention highlighted several regions including the precuneus and posterior insula. These regions are directly involved in interoceptive attention and exteroceptive attention. Interestingly, the engagement of the precuneus was greater when one person was in a painful situation caused by another individual, that is to say, when attention was focused on the social context  . \n\nOne limitation of this study was the insula sub-threshold activation reached in the interaction analysis. It should be viewed in the context of the significant main effect of the group factor. \n\nIn conclusion, all these findings indicate that affective-cognitive styles play a key role in explaining individual differences in insula reactivity when observing partners' painful facial expressions. As predicted, during cerebral processing of emotions, imaging in the PP group demonstrated a greater engagement of the posterior insula, which is involved in mapping of internal bodily and subjective feeling states. Evidence exists that the insula plays an important role in connecting emotional experience with interoceptive states  – ,  – . Beyond what was expected, imaging in the EDP group demonstrated activation in those regions that are engaged in continuously gathering and visualizing concurrent information on the self and the external world (co-perception). \n\nOther than offering new insights into individual differences in the pain empathy issue, these new data shed new light on the variability in neural networks of emotion  , and on the approach to the emotional embodiment issue  ,  – . \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"00d2ec131c247b4abf2b602fa4c16473"}
